Lesson 0
Introduction
Of all the languages invented by British author and philologist J.R.R.
Tolkien (1892–1973), the most popular has always been Quenya. It also
seems to be the most highly developed of all the languages Tolkien devised.
Indeed only two of them – Quenya and Sindarin – are so complete that one
can with some ease write substantial texts in them without resorting to mas-
sive invention of one’s own. Until recently, Sindarin was poorly understood,
and its complex phonology may daunt fresh students (especially if they have
no linguistic training). My advice to people who want to study Tolkien’s lin-
guistic creations would deﬁnitely be that they start with Quenya. Knowing
this tongue will facilitate later studies of the other languages, including Sin-
darin, since Quenya represents just one branch of the Elvish language family:
The Elvish languages are not “independent” entities, but all evolved from
a common ancestral tongue, and in many respects, Quenya stands closer to
this primitive original than the other languages.
In reality as opposed to this ﬁctional context, Tolkien knew well what
kind of style he was aiming for, and having sketched a “primitive Elvish”
language, he cleverly devised sound-shifts that would produce a tongue with
the desired ﬂavour: Quenya resulted from his youthful romance with Finnish;
he was, in his own words, “quite intoxicated” by the sound and style of
this language when he discovered it (The Letters of J.R.R.Tolkien, p. 214).
However, it should be emphasized that Finnish was an inspiration only;
Quenya is in no way a garbled version of Finnish, and only a few words of
its vocabulary display any semblance to the corresponding Finnish words.
(See Harri Per¨
ala’s discussion at http://www.sci.ﬁ/˜alboin/ﬁnn que.htm;
the writer is a Finn himself.) Tolkien also mentioned Greek and Latin as
inspirations; we can evidently add Spanish to the list as well.
The ﬁctional or “internal” history of Quenya is synopsized in my regular
Ardalambion Quenya article (see http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/quenya.
htm) and does not have to be repeated in any detail here. Very brieﬂy,
within Tolkien’s mythos Quenya was the language of the Elves that dwelt
in Valinor in the Uttermost West; being spoken in the Blessed Realm, it
6


was the noblest tongue in the world. Later one of the clans of the Elves, the
Noldor, went into exile in Middle-earth, bringing the Quenya tongue with
them. In Middle-earth it soon fell out of use as a daily speech, but among
the Noldor it was ever preserved as a ceremonial language, and as such it
was also known to Mortal Men in later ages. Hence in The Lord of the Rings
we have Frodo delivering the famous Quenya greeting elen s´
ıla l´
umenn’
omentielvo, “a star shines on the hour of our meeting”, when he and his
friends run into some Elves (and the Elves are delighted to meet “a scholar
in the Ancient Tongue”). If one studies Quenya as a way to immerse oneself
in Tolkien’s ﬁction, it may indeed be best to picture oneself as a mortal
student in Middle-earth in the Third Age, about the period covered in The
Lord of the Rings. (Picturing oneself as an Elvish native speaker in Valinor
back in the First Age may be overly ambitious.) The particular form of
Quenya taught in this course is – by intention – precisely the “late Exilic”
or “Third Age” variant. This is the kind of Quenya exempliﬁed in The Lord
of the Rings, with Galadriel’s Lament (Nam´
ari¨
e) as the most substantial
example.
Numerous enthusiasts have brought forth a limited, but steadily growing
body of Quenya literature, especially since a substantial amount of vocabu-
lary ﬁnally became available with the publication of The Lost Road in 1987,
ﬁfteen years after Tolkien’s death. Thanks to this and the ﬁfteen other books
of Middle-earth material that Christopher Tolkien in the period 1977–96
edited from the manuscripts his father had left behind, we now know very
much more about Tolkien’s languages than we ever did during the lifetime of
their inventor. We certainly can’t sit down and readily translate the works
of Shakespeare into Quenya, but we do know a few thousand words and
can infer the general outlines of the grammar Tolkien envisioned. Still, you
cannot really become “ﬂuent” in Quenya, not matter how hard you study
what is presently available. But it is eminently possible to write quite long
Quenya texts if one deliberately eschews the unfortunate gaps in our knowl-
edge, and we can at least hope that some of these gaps (especially regarding
grammatical features) will be ﬁlled in by future publications. In the future,
we may be able to develop Quenya into a more fully “useable” language. But
we must obviously start by carefully internalizing the information provided
by Tolkien’s own material, as far as it is available to us.
Many have wanted a regular “course” or “tutorial”, with exercises and
all, that would allow them to study Quenya on their own with some ease.
One such eﬀort has been made before: Nancy Martsch’ Basic Quenya. All
in all, this was certainly a good work; the fact that material that has been
published after it was written now reveals certain shortcomings, cannot be
held against the author. However, many would like to have a more updated
course, and I have repeatedly been approached by people suggesting that I
would be the right person to write it. It is of course nice when others call me
an “expert” on Tolkienian linguistics; actually I would say that it is diﬃcult
7


to be an “expert” in these matters, due to the scarcity of source material.
Nonetheless, I have been so privileged that I have been able to spend much
time studying these matters (starting more than ten years ago), and I see
it as my duty to record and pass on whatever insights I may have gained.
Hence in the end I sat down and started writing this course, intended for
beginners. (This conveniently allows me to ﬁll the uncritical, vulnerable
minds of fresh students with my interpretation of Quenya grammar, which
interpretation I inevitably hold to be the best and most accurate. Ha ha ha.)
However, this course does not seek to imitate a Linguaphone-like format
with long dialogues etc. to help the student to acquire “basic ﬂuency” in
various situations relating to everyday life. This would be quite pointless in
the case of an “art-language” like Quenya, which is to be used for carefully
prepared prose and poetry rather than casual chatting. Rather these lessons
take the form of a series of essays on various parts of Quenya grammar,
reviewing and analyzing available evidence in an attempt to reconstruct
Tolkien’s intentions, with some exercises appended.
Why study Quenya? Obviously not because you are going to Valinor on
holiday and need to be able to communicate with the natives. Some may
want to study this language to somehow get in better accord with the spirit
of Tolkien’s authorship. He referred to
. . . what I think is a primary ‘fact’ about my work, that it is all of
a piece, and fundamentally linguistic in inspiration. [. . .] It is not
a ‘hobby’, in the sense of something quite diﬀerent from one’s
work, taken up as a relief-outlet. The invention of languages is the
foundation. The ‘stories’ were made rather to provide a world for
the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes ﬁrst and the
story follows. I should have preferred to write in ‘Elvish’. But, of
course, such a work as The Lord of the Rings has been edited and
only as much ‘language’ has been left in as I thought would be
stomached by readers. (I now ﬁnd that many would have liked
more.) [. . .] It is to me, anyway, largely an essay in ‘linguistic
aesthetic’, as I sometimes say to people who ask me ‘what is it
all about’. (The Letters of J.R.R.Tolkien, pp. 219–220)
In light of such strong statements made by the author, studying his in-
vented languages cannot be dismissed as some kind of silly escapism for
romantic teenagers. It must be considered a crucial part of scholarship re-
lating to Tolkien’s authorship, or indeed his work in general: The languages
constructed by Tolkien are part of his output as a philologist, not necessar-
ily less serious than his writings on pre-existing languages like Anglo-Saxon;
notice that he refused to call his “fundamentally linguistic” work a mere
hobby. One may call Quenya and the other languages works of art, but no
matter what word we use to describe them, in the end it all boils down
8


to this: Tolkien was not just a descriptive linguist, passively exploring and
contemplating pre-existing tongues – he was a creative linguist as well.
Obviously ﬂuency in Quenya or Sindarin is not a prerequisite before you
can say anything intelligent about Tolkien’s narratives; yet it is clear that
some critics and scholars have woefully underestimated the crucial role of
the invented languages, ﬁnding themselves unable to take even very clear
statements like the one quoted above wholly seriously. To fully appreciate
the scope and intricacy of Tolkien’s linguistic sub-creation one has to actively
study it for its own sake. It should certainly be able to command interest
for its own sake. Some years ago, recognized Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey
observed that
. . . it’s clear that the languages Tolkien created are created by,
you know, one of the most accomplished philologists of all time,
so there is therefore something interesting in them, and I think
also in them there is poured much of his professional knowl-
edge and thought. [. . .] I’ve often noticed that there are really
very valuable observations about what Tolkien thought about
real philology buried in the ﬁction. And I would not be at all
surprised if, you know, there were valuable observations buried
in the invented languages. So there may be, in fact, something
which emerges from it. [From an interview conducted during the Arda
symposium in Oslo, April 3–5 1987, published in the journal Angerthas, issue
31.]
Even if one does not believe that there are great new philological insights
waiting to be unearthed from the structure of Tolkien’s languages, I cannot
see why conducting detailed studies of these languages should necessarily be
seen as escapism, or at best a somewhat silly pastime for people who are too
lazy to ﬁnd something better to do. The languages constructed by Tolkien
have been likened to music; his biographer Humphrey Carpenter observes
that “if he had been interested in music he would very likely have wanted
to compose melodies; so why should he not make up a personal system of
words that would be as it were a private symphony?” One may study one of
the languages Tolkien painstakingly developed as one may study a musical
symphony: a complex work of many interrelated parts woven into intricate
beauty. Yet the symphony is ﬁxed in its form, while a language can be
inﬁnitely recombined into ever new texts of prose and poetry, and yet retain
its nature and ﬂavour undiminished. One of the attractions of Quenya is
that we can compose linguistic “music” ourselves just by applying Tolkien’s
rules, so Carpenter’s comparison is too limited: Tolkien did not just make a
symphony, he invented an entire form of music, and it would be a pity if it
were to die with him.
Of course, others may want to study Quenya to immerse themselves in
Tolkien’s ﬁction, with no pretensions of “scholarship” of any kind: Tolkien’s
9


vision of the Elves (Quendi, Eldar) is no doubt the main achievement of his
authorship, and Quenya was – at least in the somewhat biased opinion of
the Noldor – “the chief Elvish tongue, the noblest, and the one most nearly
preserving the ancient character of Elvish speech” (The War of the Jewels
p. 374). But one may grope towards “Elvishness” in a deeper sense than just
trying to immerse oneself in ﬁction. Happily abandoning the all too classical
idea of Elves as tiny, overly pretty “fairies”, Tolkien instead achieved the
vision of Elves as something more: “I suppose that the Quendi are in fact
in these histories very little akin to the Elves and Fairies of Europe; and
if I were pressed to rationalize, I should say that they represent greater
beauty and longer life, and nobility – the Elder Children” (The Letters of
J.R.R.Tolkien, p. 176). The quintessence of Tolkien’s vision of “Elvishness”
is contained primarily in the languages, “for to the Eldar the making of
speech is the oldest of the arts and the most beloved” (The Peoples of
Middle-earth p. 398). In a way, the study of Quenya can be a quest for
this vision of something beautiful and noble beyond the normal capability
of our mortal and ﬁnite selves: “The Elves represent, as it were, the artistic,
aesthetic, and purely scientiﬁc aspects of the Humane raised to a higher level
than is actually seen in Men” (Letters, p. 176). The seeking for such a “higher
level” transcends all ﬁction. Tolkien’s inner vision of this level he translated
partly into pictures, much more prominently into narratives, but (to him)
more importantly still, into the words and sounds of language. In Quenya
his vision of Beauty lives on, awaiting those capable of comprehending and
appreciating it.
On their web-pages, the Swedish Tolkien-linguists of the Mellonath Daeron
group try to justify their study of Tolkien’s languages:
Our activity has been described as the ultimate luxury. We study
something that does not exist, just for fun. This is something you
can aﬀord when you have everything else; food, shelter, clothes,
friends, and so on. The Tolkien languages are well worth studying
for their high aesthetic values alone. And knowledge of the lan-
guages is a key to a fuller appreciation of the beauty of Tolkien’s
sub-creation, his world, Arda.
I heartily agree with the last two sentences, but I cannot agree that
Quenya or Sindarin “does not exist”. Obviously we are not talking about
physical, tangible objects, but that goes for any language. These are not ﬁc-
tional languages, but languages as real as Esperanto or any other constructed
language. Tolkien himself noted about his languages that they “have some
existence, since I have composed them in some completeness” (The Letters
of J.R.R.Tolkien, p. 175).
Unlike Esperanto, Quenya is however strongly associated with a ﬁctional
internal history. (Tolkien once stated that Esperanto had been more suc-
cessful if there had been an Esperanto mythos to go with it!) The associated
10


mythos certainly enriches Quenya and helps us to understand what kind of
linguistic “ﬂavour” Tolkien was aiming for, and the fact that this language
has a role to play in the most famous fantasy novels ever written obviously
provides it with much “free publicity” that Esperanto can only dream of.
Yet it must be emphasized that Quenya does exist as an actual entity in
our own world, and as mentioned above, it indeed has a steadily growing
literature, mostly in verse: The texts presently in existence must already be
hundreds of times more comprehensive than all the Quenya texts Tolkien
ever wrote himself. He endlessly reﬁned the structure and imaginary evo-
lution of his invented languages, but he wrote remarkably few substantial
texts in them. Though he stated that he “should have preferred to write in
‘Elvish’” (see quote above), he actually wrote about the “Elvish” tongues
rather than in them. “Delight lay in the creation itself,” Christopher Tolkien
observes (Sauron Defeated, p. 440). His father made the languages just be-
cause he loved making them, not because he needed to “use” them for any
speciﬁc purpose. To be sure, Tolkien wrote a number of poems in “Elvish”,
but they amount to very little compared to the thousands of pages he wrote
about the structure of his languages.
Tolkien had his fun in sheer invention; that was his privilege as the original
creator. However, I daresay quite few people are capable of deriving much
pleasure from mere passive contemplation of the structure of a language,
or from reading the grammar of an invented language as if it were some
kind of novel. I imagine that most people who want to study Quenya have
some intention, however vague, of putting this knowledge to use by writing
Quenya texts themselves, or at least by reading other people’s texts (at the
very least Tolkien’s own). Really learning any language in any case requires
active participation: Even if you wouldn’t dream of ever publishing anything
in Quenya but rather want to assess Tolkien’s “Elvish” for purely academic
purposes, you will still have to work yourselves through some exercises to
internalize grammar and vocabulary. Such exercises are provided in this
course.
My favorite angle on the study of Tolkien’s languages is probably this
(building on the “musical” analogy suggested by Carpenter): I’d say we
are in somewhat the same situation as if a genius composer were to invent
a new form of music, writing a great deal about its structure, but making
relatively few actual compositions – some of them not even published during
the lifetime of the composer himself. Yet these few compositions gain a
steadily growing international audience, an audience that would very much
like to hear more – much more – music of this kind. The original composer
being dead, what are we to do? There is only one way to go: We must carry
out a thorough study of both the published compositions and the more
theoretical writings, to make out and internalize the rules and principles for
this kind of music. Then we can start to compose ourselves, making entirely
new melodies that yet comply with the general structure devised by the
11


original inventor.
This, of course, has a rough analogy when it comes to Tolkien’s narratives
as well. Tolkien’s themes and principles of story-telling have been taken
over by generations of new authors, resulting in the modern fantasy genre
– though it would not be very controversial to say that far from all authors
have been able to live up to the high standards set by the master. In some-
what the same manner, the quality of the numerous post-Tolkien Quenya
texts varies greatly. In the case of some early attempts, written when very lit-
tle source material was available, it is now easy to spot various shortcomings
and misinterpretations of what Tolkien really intended. Today, with much
more material available, I would say it is possible to write texts that Tolkien
probably would have recognized as at least roughly correct Quenya (though
I think reading Quenya texts not originating with himself would have been a
strange experience for him; his invented languages were originally something
very private).
This course should in any case be useful no matter what your angle on
this study may be – whether you want to learn Quenya to immerse yourself
in Tolkien’s ﬁction, to better appreciate a crucial side of his authorship,
to learn about the intricate creations of a talented linguist, to accept the
intellectual challenge of trying to master a sophisticated system, to go on a
meditative quest for “Elvishness”, or simply to enjoy Quenya aesthetically.
None of these are mutually exclusive, of course. Whatever your angle is, I
hope you would like to have a part in making Quenya literature grow and
ﬂourish.
Another Tolkien quote may be in place here: “No language is justly studied
merely as an aid to other purposes. It will in fact better serve other purposes,
philological or historical, when it is studied for love, for itself” (MC:189).

The question of copyright
This is an issue I shall have to devote quite a few paragraphs to, though this
will probably surprise any fresh, innocent student who has never given much
thought to this at all. However, debates revolving around copyright issues
have sadly caused a great deal of bitterness among students working in the
ﬁeld of Tolkien-linguistics; such debates essentially blew apart the TolkLang
mailing list, leading to the establishing of Elﬂing instead. If Tolkien’s heirs or
their lawyers ever read what follows, I hope they are not oﬀended. This really
is not about stealing anything from them, but about directing attention to
one highly important part of Tolkien’s work and help people learning about
it, so that it can live and grow and stand as a lasting testimony to his eﬀorts,
and as a dynamic memorial to himself. Talking about his father, Christopher
Tolkien in a TV interview described Quenya as “language as he wanted it,
the language of his heart”. Students of Quenya merely want this special
12


part of Tolkien’s heart to live on. Nobody is trying to make any money or
otherwise proﬁt from this. (If the Tolkien Estate, or rather HarperCollins,
might ever want to publish this course in book form, I would be happy to
let them do so, and I would not expect to receive any royalties.)
In 1998 and early 1999, on the TolkLang list, lawyer W. C. Hicklin vo-
ciferously argued that publishing “unauthorized” grammatical descriptions
of a Tolkien-language would be a blatant violation of the copyright of the
Tolkien Estate, asserting that any such publication would undoubtedly make
the Estate react with “money, guns and lawyers”. (One hopes the part about
ﬁrearms was a ﬁgure of speech.) I cannot agree with such an interpretation
of copyright law, especially considering that what we know about Quenya
we have for the most part learnt by studying the examples we have – not
by reading Tolkien’s explicit grammars, that still have not been published.
I cannot imagine that when studying available Quenya texts, is it illegal for
us to put our conclusions into words and tell others about them. If this is
what copyright means, then all sorts of scholarly commentary and literary
criticism immediately go down the drain. While Hicklin said he reported the
position of Christopher Tolkien (whom he claimed to know on a ﬁrst-name
basis), the Tolkien Estate itself has so far declined to present its opinion
on these issues, even when asked to do so by TolkLang moderator Julian
Bradﬁeld. It may be noted that copyright law is not the area Mr. Hicklin
specializes in, and I think he pressed the concept of “character” rather far
by asserting that every individual word in the invented languages must be
considered a literary character of Tolkien’s, apparently on par with such
characters as Aragorn or Galadriel. Mysteriously, Hicklin still agreed that it
is OK to write fresh texts in Tolkien’s languages, though in Hicklin’s world
this would seem to be the analogy of writing new stories involving Tolkien’s
characters (which everybody agrees would be a copyright violation).
Hicklin’s obvious problems in putting together a consistent argument, as
well as subsequent legal inquiries conducted by myself and others, have led
me to the conclusion that copyrighting a language as such would be quite
impossible. The language “itself” is not to be likened to a ﬁxed text in or
about it; it is an entirely abstract system, and for anything to enjoy copyright
protection it must ﬁrst of all have a ﬁxed form to be protected. Arguing that
the very grammatical structure and vocabulary of the language is its “ﬁxed
form” is no use, for this is an abstract system, not a “form”. Any actual
text about (or in) a language is indeed protected, but not the language
“itself”. To return to the analogy of our genius composer who invents a new
form of music: His copyright to his own compositions, and to his writings
on this form of music as ﬁxed texts, cannot and should not be disputed by
anyone. But he or his heirs cannot well assert that publishing entirely new
compositions, or wholly original descriptions of the principles of this kind of
music, would somehow violate their copyright.
This course is written and published (for free on the Internet) by me as
13


a private person. The Tolkien Estate has not been asked to endorse it or
even comment on it, it is in no way “oﬃcial”, and I must take full respon-
sibility for the quality of the contents. No disrespect is intended when I
point out that any endorsement by the Estate would not have meant much
in the way of a quality guarantee, since certain earlier works on Quenya
that were published with explicit permission from the Estate can now be
seen to contain certain obvious shortcomings and misinterpretations. There
is little reason to believe that Estate lawyers or Christopher Tolkien himself
are capable of judging the quality of a Quenya grammar (and likewise no
reason to hold this against them; learning Quenya from the primary sources
is a long and challenging study reserved for the especially interested). In
such a situation I hope and believe that the Tolkien Estate respects the
right of scholars to carry on their studies undisturbed, and to present the
results of such research – especially when the relevant publications are en-
tirely non-commercial. Despite the strong claims made by Hicklin and a
very few others, there is presently no concrete evidence that the Estate or
Christopher Tolkien see such studies as a violation of their copyright. If they
do, let them contact me and we will talk.
The interpretation of Quenya grammar that it here set out is based on a
study of the available sources, mostly analysis of actual Quenya text, and on
exegesis of the relatively few explicit notes on grammar that are presently
available. I hold it to be obvious that this is primarily a work of analysis
and commentary (presented in a didactic fashion), and in terms of copyright,
discussing the structure of Quenya cannot be much diﬀerent from discussing
(say) the plot structure of The Lord of the Rings: In either case it is clear
that anything I can say must ultimately be based on Tolkien’s writings,
but the resulting study still is not a “derived work” in terms of copyright
law. What we are doing here is not retelling Tolkien’s ﬁction (though I will
certainly refer to it – but then from the perspective of a critic, or better com-
mentator, to demonstrate how Tolkien’s ﬁction and language-construction
interlock). Primarily we will be studying one of Tolkien’s languages as an
actual rather than a ﬁctitious entity. The fact that this language was ﬁrst
presented to the world in a context of ﬁction does not make it a “ﬁctional
language”, and use or discussion of it is not necessarily “derivative ﬁction”.
As already mentioned, Tolkien himself observed that his languages as such
“have some existence” simply because he had actually devised them – they
do not exclusively reside within a ﬁctitious context (The Letters of J.R.R.
Tolkien, p. 175).
Much of Quenya vocabulary is not wholly “original”; Tolkien readily ad-
mitted that the vocabularies of his “Elvish” languages were “inevitably full
of . . . reminiscences” of pre-existing tongues (The Peoples of Middle-earth
p. 368). Though usually not so obvious that it is disturbing to those who
want to study Quenya as a highly exotic language, the fact remains that the
knowledgeable easily discern Indo-European (and sometimes even Semitic)
14


words and stems underlying many of Tolkien’s “invented” words. This is not
to be seen as some sort of failure of imagination on Tolkien’s part; he noted
that “it is impossible in constructing imaginary languages from a limited
number of component sounds to avoid such resemblances” – adding that
he did not even try to avoid them (Letters, pp. 384–385). Even where no
plausible “real-world” inspiration for a Quenya word can be cited, the fact
still remains that there is no legal tradition whatsoever to allow a person
coining new words to somehow claim them as his personal property. Tolkien
himself was aware that names cannot be copyrighted (Letters, p. 349), and
then one cannot well copyright common nouns, verbs, adjectives or preposi-
tions either, precluding “unauthorized” use of them. Some words in common
use today, such as robot, ﬁrst occurred in a context of ﬁction. One cannot
therefore claim that they are “ﬁctional” words, protected on par with ﬁc-
tional characters, and not to be used, listed or explained without explicit
permission from the one who ﬁrst coined them (or his heirs).
Legal inquiries conducted after Hicklin made his ﬂamboyant claims have
conﬁrmed that words as such automatically enter public domain the second
they are coined, and nobody can monopolize them or claim exclusive owner-
ship to them. You can register a word as a trademark, of course, but that is
something entirely diﬀerent: Apple Computers can’t stop anyone from using
“apple” as an everyday word. It is also irrelevant that the manufacturer of
some kind of fantasy game had to remove all references to “balrogs”, for
here it is not the Sindarin word balrog, but balrogs as characters that lie in
Tolkien’s copyright. The fact that Tolkien coined the word alda for “tree”
hardly implies that trees are his literary characters. It is not just a tree
growing in Middle-earth that can be termed an alda; the word works just
as well if I write a Quenya poem about a tree growing outside my house.
I agree, though, that Quenya and the other languages enjoy some protec-
tion in their capacity as parts of the Middle-earth setting. If anyone were to
write new fantasy stories involving Elves speaking a language called Quenya,
and there were samples demonstrating that this is indeed Tolkien’s Quenya,
this would obviously be the same kind of plagiarism as if any fantasy writer
were to “borrow” a city called Minas Tirith, and the description in the book
made it clear that this city happened to be built on several levels and was
overlooked by a white tower. But again: this course is most certainly not in-
tended as derivative ﬁction. This is about studying and using one of Tolkien’s
languages largely irrespective of the ﬁctional context as such – though since
I also aspire to present Quenya as a part of Tolkien’s authorship, I shall of
course have to mention, refer to and sometimes even quote the narratives
as well as presenting mere technicalities. Nonetheless: It is obviously untrue
that Tolkien’s languages cannot in any way be separated from his ﬁctional
world (as Hicklin seemed to claim). Vicente Velasco was for instance able
to write a Quenya poem (R´
ıanna) commemorating Princess Diana after her
tragic death, but this does not imply that the accident where she was killed
15


must actually be a plot point in a Tolkien novel. Indeed Tolkien himself made
a Quenya translation of the Lord’s Prayer, a text that obviously belongs to
our own reality and could not occur within the Middle-earth setting.
When discussing copyright issues, we must distinguish very clearly be-
tween the ﬁctional context and actual use of systems or ideas described
within this ﬁction; the latter is quite irrelevant for a discussion of copyright.
By way of comparison: I fully agree that if anyone were to write new fantasy
stories involving a race of small people with hairy feet living in underground
structures called smials, then this writer would clearly plagiarize Tolkien
and possibly even violate his copyright. But I cannot imagine that I violate
anyone’s copyright if I dig out a smial in my garden – or for that matter,
if I have a head-to-feet hair transplant. Similarly, one shouldn’t feel free
to write fantasy stories about Elves speaking Quenya, but actually using
the linguistic structures dreamed up by Tolkien to write new texts that by
their contents have nothing to do with his ﬁction cannot be a violation of
copyright. The new Quenya texts are copyright to no one but their writers.
Happily, Tolkien’s heirs seem to agree to this; at least they have never
tried to stop anyone from publishing their Quenya poems. If the Estate has
no problems with this, I can only assume that their lawyers also agree that
it is perfectly legal for anyone to write Quenya grammars or compile Quenya
wordlists. Otherwise we should be left with the rather absurd notion of a
language that can be used, but not taught or in a scholarly way described.
I cannot imagine that the Estate would assert that the by now quite large
number of Quenya texts that are not written by Tolkien and have nothing
to do with his ﬁction cannot be subjected to grammatical or lexicographical
studies simply because they happen to be written in Quenya. This would
be an attempt to block and veto certain kinds of scholarship relating to an
entire body of literature, and I don’t think this could be sustained, legally
or even morally. I don’t know that Tolkien’s heirs disagree.
I have no intention, however, of disputing the Estate’s copyright to Tol-
kien’s actual writings (on the languages or otherwise), and though it is an
interesting exercise to “reconstruct the Elvish original” supposedly under-
lying some of Tolkien’s poems or stories, one should not publish “Elvish”
translations of a great amount of continuous Tolkien text. All of his texts
lie in the copyright of the Tolkien Estate until it expires in 2023 (or was
it 2048?), and publishing substantial translations or close retellings thereof
would require the permission of the Estate: No matter how exceedingly es-
oteric the target-language is, any translation is still directly derived from
Tolkien’s own, copyrighted text. Neither should one write long stories set in
Tolkien’s world; that would be a violation of copyright no matter what lan-
guage you use. However, making translations of a limited amount of Tolkien
text can probably pass as fair use (but please don’t publish your own Quenya
rendering of the Ring Poem; there are all too many competing versions al-
ready. . . ) Neither is there much reason to believe that the Estate would take
16


any action against short Quenya-language novelettes even if they do seem
to be set in Middle-earth, since it should be obvious that the real purpose
is to demonstrate the use of Quenya, not to write new stories to compete
with Tolkien’s own (I wouldn’t publish even such novelettes in any way that
could conceivably be seen as commercial publishing, though). Poems about
persons or events in Tolkien’s world (like Ales Bican’s Roccalassen or “Song
to ´
Eowyn”) I think can pass as a branch of commentary or synopsis, as long
as you don’t include any fresh ﬁction of your own. But please don’t push
even that too far; Tolkien’s heirs are in their good right when they assert
their copyright to his stories.
In exercises made for this course, I have in any case deliberately avoided
any direct references to persons, places or events in Tolkien’s ﬁctional world
(except for one reference to the Two Trees because the Quenya word pro-
vides such a good example of dual number). Instead of referring to Tolkien’s
ﬁction I have in most cases resorted to a wholly generic fantasy world or me-
dieval world; there is nothing to preclude the possibility that this is Tolkien’s
world, but nothing concrete to conﬁrm it, either. There are lots of Elves and
Dwarves in these exercises, but though we inevitably use words like Eldar
and Naucor for these peoples when talking about them in Quenya, they
are really just “generic” Elves and Dwarves. Feel free to imagine that these
“Elves” are Tolkien’s Eldar if you like, but there is nothing that deﬁnitely
ties them to any speciﬁc mythos.
Despite the fact that I don’t think the Tolkien Estate could legally stop
people from doing pretty much what they want with Quenya as an actual
language (separated from Tolkien’s ﬁction), I urge students to use whatever
knowledge they may obtain in a respectful way. We should feel some kind
of moral obligation, or even gratitude, towards Tolkien as the creator of
this language. Quenya as we know it is the result of decades of painstaking
work and endless reﬁnement; its creator intended it to have an august or
even sacred ﬂavour, and it is not to be used for unworthy or downright silly
purposes. (Please don’t publish your Quenya compositions on toilet walls,
for instance.) There is an old TV interview where Tolkien says he would
not necessarily mind others knowing and enjoying his invented languages,
but he would not like to see any of them turned into some sort of “secret”
lingo used to exclude others. This is a wish I urge any and all students to
respect. As a student and user of Quenya one should also be committed to
preserving the integrity of Tolkien’s system, taking great care not to distort
it or needlessly dilute it. Occasionally we have to coin new words, but in such
cases one should eschew arbitrary invention and instead work from Tolkien’s
own stems, using his methods of derivation.
Wrote Tolkien, “Of course the L[ord of the] R[ings] does not belong to
me. It has been brought forth and must now go its appointed way in the
world, though naturally I take a deep interest in its fortunes, as a parent
would of a child. I am comforted to know that it has good friends to defend
17


it” (The Letters of J.R.R.Tolkien, p. 413–14). Perhaps he would have felt
the same way about the invented languages exempliﬁed in the book he is
talking about: They have been brought forth and do already go their “way
in the world”, studied and even used by many – but now Quenya and the
other languages must live their lives independently of their “parent”, for he
is no longer among us. So let students and users be their “good friends” and
“defend” their systems, true to the vision of the man who spent a lifetime
developing them. And this brings us back to the structure of Quenya itself.
0.2
What is Quenya like?
What kind of language is this, structurally speaking? It seems that Finnish
provided considerable inspiration not only for the sound-patterns, but for
the basic structure as well. Tolkien described Quenya as a “highly inﬂected
language” (The Road Goes Ever On p. 69). That is, words appear in many
diﬀerent forms depending on their precise function in any given grammatical
context. The diﬀering forms are for the most part constructed by employing
a plethora of endings, endings with meanings that in English would often
be expressed as separate words instead. Hence an English translation of a
Quenya text will normally consist of more words than the Quenya original:
In Unﬁnished Tales p. 22, 51, we learn that three words of Quenya may
well require a seven-word English translation: Anar caluva tielyanna =
“the sun shall shine upon your path”. Some may see this as evidence that
Quenya is a more eﬃcient language than English, but whether one uses one
long word or several shorter words to express a given meaning is not very
crucial. (It may be noted that if one counts syllables instead of words, it
is suddenly English that is the most “eﬃcient” language in the example
above: The English text has one syllable less than the Quenya version!)
Quenya should be enjoyed for its own qualities, not by comparing it to
other languages. But the word tielyanna “upon your path” illustrates the
main diﬀerence between English and Quenya: small independent words like
“your” or “upon” frequently become endings instead – in this example -lya
and -nna, respectively.
Is Quenya a “diﬃcult” language? Speaking of Quenya and Sindarin, the
two main languages of his mythos, Tolkien wrote that “both languages are,
of course, extremely diﬃcult” (Letters:403). Undoubtedly there are many
presently unsuspected complexities waiting for us in the vast amount of
unpublished material. But as far or short as our knowledge goes today, I
certainly wouldn’t call Quenya “extremely diﬃcult”. It may be an involved
and intricate construct, but certainly less complicated than Sindarin, and
the acquisition of Quenya as we know it is in no way a superhuman feat. Any
devoted student should be able to achieve basic mastery of the grammatical
system in relatively short time, weeks or even days rather than months.
18


General knowledge about linguistics would certainly be helpful in such a
study, but hardly a prerequisite; in this course I have tried to make the
explanations so simple that any reasonably bright teenager should be able
to understand what is going on. (Bearing in mind that some people who
want to study Quenya are quite young, I have tried to pre-suppose virtually
no knowledge about linguistics, and I will explain even elementary linguistic
terms – more knowledgeable students may feel that I sometimes go into
boring baby-talk.)
It must still be understood that it is not a streamlined Esperanto we are
dealing with here. Tolkien deliberately tried to make his languages “natural-
istic”; hence there are some irregular verbs and the like, though I would say
their number is quite manageable. Quenya probably stands about midway
between an absolutely regular “Esperanto” and a typical “real” language
with its spate of complexities and irregularities, yet perhaps closer to the
former. Indeed Quenya is probably too simple to be entirely “credible” as a
supposedly non-constructed language, at least if we compare it to the messy
languages of Mortal Men in our own age. But then Quenya wasn’t really
“non-constructed” within the scope of the ﬁctional history either; it was
constructed and reﬁned by the Elves, “and the Eldar know their tongue,
not word by word only, but as a whole” (The Peoples of Middle-earth p.
398). So perhaps the Eldar, being very much conscious of the structure of
their speech, would tend to make languages with a relatively tidy grammar.
Anyway, from the viewpoint of students it is diﬃcult to regret the absence of
more irregular forms to be memorized, so if this simplicity does indeed make
Quenya less “credible” as a natural language, Tolkien is easily forgiven!
0.3
The sources
We know that Tolkien wrote literally thousands of pages about his languages.
Unfortunately – and here I must ask fresh students to brazen themselves for
their ﬁrst big shock, though the shocking fact has already been alluded to –
very little of this material is available to us. However, Christopher Tolkien
has apparently tried to make arrangements for its publication. Throughout
most of the nineties, he was sending photo-copies of his father’s linguistic
manuscripts to a group of Americans often (but unoﬃcially) referred to as
the Elfconners, apparently because of their prominence on the “cons” or
conventions of ELF, the “Elvish Linguistic Fellowship”.
However, the most outspoken member of the group seems to have con-
vinced himself beyond refutation that the term “Elfconners” was always
meant to be derogatory, associating it with “conning” or deception. As
pointed out by TolkLang moderator Julian Bradﬁeld, it may be that this
member of the group is inventing insults against himself, but currently it
is politically correct to refer to this group simply as the Editorial Team,
19


abbreviated ET. Whatever we call them, the group consists of Christopher
Gilson, Carl F. Hostetter, Patrick Wynne and Arden R. Smith (in recent
years, Bill Welden has also joined in). Before they started to receive Tolkien
manuscripts, these people quite regularly published the Tolkien-linguistic
journals Vinyar Tengwar (edited by Hostetter) and Parma Eldalamberon
(edited by Gilson), generally maintaining a high standard. This, we must
assume, was the reason why Christopher Tolkien wanted them to publish
his father’s linguistic manuscripts in the ﬁrst place.
The very strange and most unfortunate fact is that after they started re-
ceiving Tolkien manuscripts for publication, the group’s rate of publication
dropped disastrously. They began to receive manuscript copies in 1991; a
decade later they have managed to get a few hundred pages of new material
into print (most of it wordlist material pertaining to the very earliest stages
of Tolkien’s work, far removed from the LotR scenario). Some of us are not
impressed. What little material has appeared has been nicely presented, but
with the present rate of publication, the completion of the project must be
very far oﬀindeed. In 1996, Christopher Gilson stated that “next year”,
his group planned to publish “fairly comprehensive” grammars for the two
main languages of Tolkien’s mythos. In early 2002 they ﬁnally published
some material relating to certain stages of “Gnomish”, an early conceptual
ancestor of the language Tolkien later called Sindarin; we are still waiting
for a really substantial amount of material about Quenya. Most other dead-
lines that the members of Gilson’s group have set for themselves has proved
equally worthless, and since about 1998 they have largely refrained from
stating any deadlines at all. Still, we must hope that in ten (or twenty, or
thirty. . . ) years, we will know more – but if the Editorial Team is able to
ever commence eﬃcient, regular publication of Tolkien’s material, they have
yet to demonstrate this ability.
We must work, then, from sources already available – sources that often
touch on the languages more or less incidentally. The linguistic aspect of
Tolkien’s authorship luckily permeates his works to such an extent that if
you bring together all the scattered pieces of information and analyze them
thoroughly, you will be able to ﬁgure out much about his languages even
without access to his explicit grammars. Unfortunately this method of study
will leave many gaps in our knowledge, gaps most irritating to people who
try to actually use these languages. In other cases, the material is so scarce
that we can formulate not just one but all too many theories about what
the underlying grammatical rules look like, and we don’t have any further
examples that would allow us to identify the correct theory. Nonetheless,
we do know a great deal about Quenya, though some of our knowledge is
more tentative than we would like. A survey of the sources is in place here;
at least I should explain the abbreviations used in this work.
The primary narrative works, The Lord of the Rings (LotR, 1954–55)
and The Silmarillion (Silm, 1977) need no further introduction. (Of course,
20


there is also The Hobbit, but this book contains little linguistic information,
and hardly anything at all about Quenya.) Most of the Elvish names of
people and places found in LotR (such as Aragorn, Glorﬁndel, Galadriel,
Minas Tirith) are Sindarin, but there are substantial samples of Quenya as
well. In LotR, we ﬁnd one of the longest Quenya texts known, the poem
Nam´
ari¨
e near the end of chapter VIII (“Farewell to L´
orien”) in Book Two
in the ﬁrst volume, The Fellowship of the Ring. Also known as Galadriel’s
Lament, this is the poem commencing with the words Ai! lauri¨
e lantar
lassi s´
urinen. . .
Various shorter samples of Quenya are also sprinkled throughout LotR,
such as Frodo speaking in tongues in Shelob’s lair (“Aiya E¨
arendil Elenion
Ancalima! he cried, and he knew not what he had spoken”), the praise that
the Ringbearers received on the Field of Cormallen (part Sindarin, part
Quenya), Elendil’s Declaration as repeated by Aragorn at his coronation,
and Treebeard’s greeting to Celeborn and Galadriel. The Quenya parts of
the Cormallen Praise (as I shall refer to it), as found in volume 3, Book
Six, chapter IV (“The Field of Cormallen”), go like this: A laita te, laita
te! Andave laituvalmet! . . . Cormacolindor, a laita t´
arienna! (Cf.
Sauron Defeated p. 47.) This is translated in The Letters of J.R.R.Tolkien,
p. 308: “Bless them, bless them, long we will praise them.” – “The Ring
bearers, bless (or praise) them to the height.”
In the next chapter (V) we have Elendil’s Declaration, repeated by Ara-
gorn at his coronation: Et E¨
arello Endorenna ut´
ulien. Sinome maru-
van ar hildinyar tenn’ Ambar-metta. This is translated in the text as
“out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide,
and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.” Treebeard’s Greeting in the
chapter after that (VI) goes a vanimar, vanim´
alion nostari, translated
both in Letters p. 308 (“o beautiful ones, parents of beautiful children”) and
Sauron Defeated p. 73 (“fair ones begetters of fair ones”; this rendering is
the more literal).
Quenya material (though mostly isolated words only) also occur in the
Appendices to LotR, in particular Appendix E.
In the Silmarillion, we also have a few short Quenya sentences. In chapter
20 there are some battle-cries: ´
Ut´
ulie’n aur¨
e! Aiya Eldali¨
e ar Atanat´
ari,
ut´
ulie’n aur¨
e! “The day has come! Behold, people of the Eldar and Fathers
of Men, the day has come!” – Auta i l´
om¨
e! “The night is passing!” – Aur¨
e
entuluva! “Day shall come again!” Near the end of chapter 21 there is the
cry a T´
urin Turambar turun ambartanen, “o T´
urin master of doom by
doom mastered” – but Unﬁnished Tales p. 138 indicates that turun should
rather read tur´
un’ (evidently shortened from a longer form tur´
una, the
ﬁnal -a dropping out because the next word also begins in a-). The Silmar-
illion Appendix, “Elements in Quenya and Sindarin names”, also mentions
many words belonging to these two languages.
In the case of other sources, a more summary survey will suﬃce, since
21


these books and journals (unlike LotR and Silm!) have not appeared in too
many editions and translations. Hence I can simply refer to the relevant
book and page when quoting from them, and that reference will hopefully
be precise enough. We will list them by the abbreviations used hereinafter:
• RGEO: The Road Goes Ever On (our page references are to the Second
Edition of 1978, ISBN 0-04-784011-0). The ﬁrst edition was published
in 1968; this is thus one of our very few sources outside LotR that were
published in Tolkien’s own lifetime, which lends it extra authority (for
when something had been published, he would normally consider it
a ﬁxed and unchangeable part of the mythos). While RGEO is ba-
sically a song cycle (Tolkien’s poems with music by Donald Swann),
Tolkien also included quite extensive notes on two Elvish poems occur-
ring in LotR, Nam´
ari¨
e and the Sindarin hymn A Elbereth Gilthoniel
(RGEO:66–76). Besides writing them out in F¨
eanorian script, he also
provided an interlinear translation of both; this allows us to know
with certainty which word means what. He also rearranged Nam´
ari¨
e
into a clearer “prose” version, as an alternative to the poetic version
in LotR – providing us with a unique opportunity to compare poetic
style and prose style in Quenya. Hence I will sometimes refer to the
“prose Nam´
ari¨
e ”.
• UT: Unﬁnished Tales (1980, ISBN 0-04-823208-4). A posthumously
published collection of material supplementing and sometimes ﬂeshing
out the stories of LotR and Silm, though as the title implies, not all of
it was ever ﬁnished by the author. Of particular interest to students
of Elvish is Cirion’s Oath found in UT:305: Vanda sina termaruva
Elenna·n´
or¨
eo alcar enyalien ar Elendil vorondo voronw¨
e. Nai
tiruvantes i h´
arar mahalmassen mi N´
umen ar i Eru i or ily¨
e
mahalmar e¨
a tennoio. The (not entirely literal) translation given
in the text goes: “This oath shall stand in memory of the glory of the
Land of the Star, and of the faith of Elendil the Faithful, in the keeping
of those who sit upon the thrones of the West and of the One who is
above all thrones for ever.” Tolkien added some interesting notes about
the Quenya words (UT:317), allowing us to analyze the Oath itself.
• Letters: The Letters of J.R.R.Tolkien (1981, ISBN 0-04-440664-9).
Edited by Humphrey Carpenter, Tolkien’s biographer, this collection
of letters also contains some linguistic information. Readers of LotR
occasionally wrote to Tolkien asking questions touching on the samples
of Quenya and Sindarin found in that work, and this being Tolkien’s
favourite subject, he often wrote fairly detailed answers. Among other
things, Letters provides translations of some Elvish samples that are
not translated in the LotR itself, e.g. Aiya E¨
arendil Elenion Ancal-
ima = “hail E¨
arendil brightest of stars” (Letters:385; we have already
quoted the translation of the Cormallen Praise in Letters:308).

• MC: The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays (1983, ISBN
0-04-809019-0). This book contains Tolkien’s essay A Secret Vice (MC:
198–223), in which he sets out his thoughts and theories about lan-
guage-construction in general. He also included some “Elvish” poems,
most notably Oilima Markirya or “The Last Ark”, which is listed in
several versions. The version of Markirya that is most interesting to
people studying the kind of Quenya exempliﬁed in LotR, is found in
MC:221–223 (including some valuable annotation).
Having edited and published Silm, UT and MC from the papers his fa-
ther had left behind, Christopher Tolkien commenced what would become
a highly ambitious project. In the period 1983–1996, he published a series
of no less than twelve volumes, demonstrating how his father had developed
his world-famous narratives over many years. The History of Middle-earth
series (HoME) presents the many “layers” of manuscripts, chronicling how
the Silmarillion and LotR as we know them gradually came into being, and
also presenting other materials relating to Tolkien’s vast mythology. For con-
venience I will list all the volumes of HoME by their standard abbreviations,
though I will not actually quote from each and every one of them:
• LT1: The Book of Lost Tales 1 (1983, ISBN 0-04-823231-5)
• LT2: The Book of Lost Tales 2 (1984, ISBN 0-04-823338-2)

Each of these books provide clues to the structure of Tolkien’s languages,
though often in a somewhat incidental fashion (Christopher Tolkien included
relatively little of his father’s narrowly linguistic writings, which being highly
technical would be of limited interest to the general readership). For people
interested in Tolkien’s languages as they appear in LotR, the most important
volumes of HoME are LR, WJ and SD, which any serious student of these
languages should have in his or her private library. The only long Quenya
text occurring in HoME, F´
ıriel’s Song, is found in LR:72 – but more im-
portantly, these books reproduce three important source documents that I
23


will often refer to simply by name (as do most students of Tolkien’s linguis-
tic creation). Therefore, they will be brieﬂy described here. We are talking
about the Etymologies and the essays Quendi and Eldar and Lowdham’s
Report.
1. The Etymologies (called “Etym” for short) is found in LR:347–400. (I
should mention that there are diﬀerent editions of LR around, so there
is unfortunately more than one pagination; my page references are to
the edition normally used by Tolkien-linguists.) To casual readers un-
doubtedly the most baﬄing document in the entire HoME series, this
is our most important single source of “Elvish” vocabulary. However,
it is not a regular dictionary. It is an alphabetical list of about six
hundred primitive “bases” or roots, the various entries listing actual
words derived from these roots as they appeared in later Elvish lan-
guages (sometimes the actual ulterior “primitive Elvish” form is also
mentioned, closely reﬂecting the “base” itself). For instance, under
the entry ´
alak (LR:348), itself deﬁned “rushing”, we ﬁnd this series:
“*alk-w¯
a swan: Q alqa; T alpa; ON alpha; N alf.” Tolkien’s idea is
that the Primitive Elvish word alk-w¯
a developed into Q[uenya] alqa,
T[elerin] alpa, O[ld] N[oldorin] alpha and N[oldorin] alf. The Ety-
mologies was written in the second half of the thirties, and the spelling
and general concepts diﬀer somewhat from the scenario of the LotR
as published in the early ﬁfties. (If we were to “update” the sample
just quoted, we must read Sindarin for Noldorin, and Quenya alqa
and “Noldorin”/Sindarin alf should rather be spelt alqua and alph,
respectively – both words, so spelt, are actually attested in later writ-
ings.) Despite the fact that the Etymologies in some respects reﬂects a
somewhat “outdated” linguistic scenario, Tolkien undertaking impor-
tant revisions after he wrote Etym, it is still a gold-mine of information
(and as we have just demonstrated, it can to some extent readily be
“updated” in accordance with Tolkien’s later ideas). Of all the lan-
guages Tolkien mentioned in Etym, Quenya is in any case among the
tongues that were not very signiﬁcantly aﬀected by his subsequent re-
visions. (In the case of “Noldorin”, on the other hand, he would tinker
with its phonology and imaginary evolution, and drastically alter its
internal history, to produce Sindarin as we know it from LotR.)
2. Quendi and Eldar (sometimes “Q&E” for short) is found in WJ:360–
417. This is ostensibly an essay on the “Origin and Meanings of the
Elvish words referring to Elves and their varieties. With Appendices
on their names for other Incarnates”. This ground is certainly cov-
ered, but luckily (from our point of view!) there are many digressions,
appendices and notes that provide much extra information about the
Elvish languages as Tolkien had come to see them in the post-LotR pe-
riod: This essay dates from ca. 1959–60. Christopher Tolkien felt that
24


one substantial section departed too radically from the stated subject
of the essay, and edited it out (see WJ:359, 396). Luckily, the omitted
section was later published in the journal Vinyar Tengwar, issue #39.
When I quote from Quendi and Eldar, I will therefore sometimes refer
to WJ and sometimes to Vinyar Tengwar (VT). “Digressive” though
the section that appeared in VT may be, it is of course of immense
interest to people studying Tolkien’s languages.
3. Lowdham’s Report, or in full Lowdham’s Report on the Adunaic Lan-
guage, can be found in SD:413–440. As the title implies, this report is
mainly concerned with another language than Quenya: Adunaic (in the
LotR appendices spelt Adˆ
unaic), the vernacular of N´
umenor. However,
a little information about Quenya, which in this report is referred to
as “Avallonian”, can also be gleaned – the two languages sometimes
being compared or contrasted. (“Lowdham” is just a ﬁctional char-
acter of Tolkien’s. Tolkien sometimes presented even quite technical
information about his languages as if he were merely quoting or refer-
ring the observations and viewpoints of various people residing within
his mythos. Among his favourite ﬁctional “sources” we ﬁnd F¨
eanor,
the greatest but also the proudest of the Noldor, R´
umil the sage of
Tirion, and Pengolodh the loremaster of Gondolin: Many of Tolkien’s
characters seem to share their author’s interest in mysterious scripts
and strange languages.)
The sources so far mentioned are the ones published or edited by Tolkien
himself or by his son – except for Letters, that was edited by Humphrey Car-
penter. In addition there are a few works edited and published by others.
Some very brief scraps of information can be extracted from J.R.R.Tolkien
– Artist and Illustrator, edited by Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull.
The results of the Editorial Team, scarce but not unimportant, must also be
mentioned. The journal Vinyar Tengwar (VT), edited by Carl F. Hostetter,
had its “golden age” in the period 1988–93, when the editor managed to up-
hold continuous bimonthly publication. When Hostetter and the other ET
members in the early nineties started to receive original Tolkien material of
the utmost interest to be edited and published, the rate of publication mys-
teriously dropped to about one issue a year, and this situation has continued
throughout the latter half of the nineties and into the new decade. Not all of
the few issues that have been published include any new Tolkien material,
and those that do are usually devoted to very short scraps (that are moreover
samples of very early material that is often clearly not LotR-compatible).
A few issues do stand out, however, and one of them has already been
mentioned: In issue #39, July 1998, Hostetter published the part of Quendi
and Eldar that Christopher Tolkien left out of WJ, as well as the companion
essay ´
Osanwe-kenta (the latter is not strictly linguistic by its subject, but
Tolkien nonetheless mentioned quite a few Quenya words). Some useful ma-
25


terial also appeared in issue #41, July 2000, ﬁlling certain annoying gaps in
our vocabulary (in particular regarding the verb “can”) and providing inter-
esting new information about the formation of the present tense. In January
2002, various Quenya translations of the Pater Noster and the Ave Maria
were published in issue #43; Tolkien the Catholic produced more than one
Elvish version of these texts.
The other main results of the ET’s editing eﬀorts for the most part con-
sist of wordlist material: the Gnomish Lexicon (GL) and the Qenya Lexicon
(QL, a.k.a. the Qenyaqetsa, abbreviated QQ). The GL also mentions a few
“Qenya” words (just like the QL mentions some Gnomish words; the lan-
guages are not infrequently compared or contrasted). Regarding “Qenya” as
opposed to (LotR-style) Quenya, see below. These Lexicons were published
in issues #11 and #12 of the journal Parma Eldalamberon, 1995 and 1998,
respectively. They were originally written during World War I, when the ear-
liest form of Tolkien’s mythos began to take shape: The QL manuscript is
usually dated to 1915, the GL to 1917. Substantial excerpts were published
already in 1983–84, Christopher Tolkien drawing heavily on the Lexicons in
the appendices to LT1 and LT2. Preﬁxed to each Lexicon, Parma also pub-
lished some related material: a never ﬁnished Gnomish Grammar in #11,
and some phonological descriptions for “Qenya” in #12.
Of the actual Quenya samples so far mentioned, I shall often refer to
Nam´
ari¨
e, Treebeard’s Greeting, Elendil’s Declaration, Cirion’s Oath, F´
ıriel’s
Song and Markirya simply by title or “name”, not always providing a ref-
erence to book and page. From the discussion above the student will know
where they are found (if you feel the urge to check the accuracy of my
quotes!) In most other cases I will provide a reference when I quote some-
thing, since it will usually be found in one of the sources that do allow a
precise reference to book and page (since there is not a spate of diﬀerent
editions with diﬀering pagination around). When I refer to entries in the
Etymologies (in LR), I simply quote the entry-head, which can easily be
located in all the various editions (irrespective of diﬀering pagination).

A word of warning regarding
parts of the corpus
Scattered in the sources listed above we have a total Quenya “corpus” that
would amount to very roughly 150 pages if it were all brought together
(though most of this would unfortunately just be unconnected wordlist ma-
terial; the samples of actual text are much rarer and could probably be
ﬁtted into no more than two or three pages). But here a word of warning is
in place: If you want to learn the kind of Quenya that you have encountered
in LotR, not all of the samples found in this corpus are entirely “reliable”
– even though they are certainly genuine Tolkien. To avoid what is poten-
26


tially a quagmire of confusion, the student should immediately internalize
one fact: The kind of Quenya exempliﬁed in LotR is not the only kind of
Quenya there is. If you start analyzing all the samples of Quenya that we
now have, you will soon realize that they do not form a homogenous mass.
Most samples certainly “look” much the same, never straying too far from
the Finnish-inspired word-shapes, but much of the early material (never
published during Tolkien’s lifetime) can be shown to employ or presuppose
words, inﬂectional endings and grammatical rules that diﬀer from the sys-
tem of LotR-style Quenya. By all means, no sample is entirely diﬀerent from
LotR-style Quenya – but in material predating the mid-thirties, neither is
there any sample that is entirely identical.
Tolkien was, so to speak, all too good when it came to devising languages.
Fixing them in one clear-cut and unchangeable form was an almost impos-
sible task form him. There were ever new ideas that he wanted to work into
their structure, even if these ideas contradicted and obsoleted things that
he had written earlier. We can be sure that his ﬁctional character Lowdham
speaks for Tolkien himself (SD:240):
In making up a language you are free: too free [. . .] When you’re
just inventing, the pleasure or fun is in the moment of invention;
but as you are the master your whim is law, and you may want
to have the fun all over again, fresh. You’re liable to be for ever
niggling, altering, reﬁning, wavering, according to your linguistic
mood and to your changes of taste.
With the posthumous publication of many of Tolkien’s writings, we got
evidence for plenty of ‘niggling, altering, reﬁning, and wavering’ on his part.
It is now evident that Quenya appeared in many incarnations, and while they
all share the same general “style” and would probably look the same to a
fresh student, they actually diﬀer in many details of grammar, vocabulary
and even phonology. A powerful demonstration of the extent of Tolkien’s
revisions is provided by the Markirya poem, which exists in one version
dating from the early thirties (MC:213) and another that is about forty
years younger, dating from the last decade of Tolkien’s life (MC:221–223).
Both versions have (almost) the same meaning, but the late version is in
the full sense of the word a translation of the former, not a mere rewriting:
Only a few words and inﬂectional endings are common to both texts.
Since Tolkien in pre-LotR sources typically used the spelling Qenya in-
stead of Quenya (though the intended pronunciation is the same), I and
others often use “Qenya” (preferably in quotes) as a name of early variants
of Quenya that are more or less diﬀerent from the form that appears in LotR
and later sources. The ﬁrst version of Markirya I would thus call a “Qenya”
poem; only the later version is Quenya as we know it from LotR. Some
other poems reproduced in MC (Nieninqe and Earendel, pp. 215–216), as
27


well as an alternative “Last Ark” poem of another meaning than the clas-
sical Markirya (MC:221), are also decidedly “Qenya” rather than Quenya.
These texts may certainly be enjoyed for their own qualities, but as source-
material for students trying to ﬁgure out the structure of LotR-style Quenya
they exclude themselves.
As we would expect, the language generally becomes more and more sim-
ilar to its “ﬁnal form” the closer we get to Tolkien’s writing LotR. For
instance, the relatively late text F´
ıriel’s Song is almost, but not quite LotR-
style Quenya. However, one should not have a simplistic view of these things,
thinking that Tolkien started out in 1915 with a language that was wildly
diﬀerent from the Quenya of LotR and that it “gradually” evolved into LotR-
style Quenya in a nice and tidy evolutionary line. The scarcity of published
material does not allow us to follow the process in any detail, but it is al-
ready evident that Tolkien kept changing his mind back and forth, not only
doing revisions but frequently also undoing them later: Indeed some of the
very earliest material, written during WWI, gives an overall impression of
being more similar to LotR-style Quenya than certain “Qenya” poems of the
early thirties. It may seem that Tolkien, rather than boldly “progressing”
toward LotR-style Quenya, made a series of detours on the way, sometimes
venturing oﬀinto radical revisions that eventually proved dissatisfying and
were rejected. Yet in other cases certain revisions proved durable, Tolkien
evidently perceiving them as genuine improvements – but the whole process
was wholly unpredictable, for in a game like this there could be no imagin-
able objective criteria for what constitutes an improvement: As Tolkien had
Lowdham saying, “Your whim is law.”
Something really close to LotR-style Quenya seems to have made its ﬁrst
appearance in the latter half of the thirties, with the writing of the Etymolo-
gies. But it is not to be thought that everything was completely settled even
after LotR had been written and published in the ﬁrst half of the ﬁfties;
Tolkien indeed used the opportunity to tinker just a little with even the
published samples of Quenya in this work when a revised edition appeared
in 1966 (and even more niggling was certainly going on behind the scenes).
Seven years later he died, and there is little reason to believe that he ever
managed (or even seriously tried) to ﬁx Quenya and his other languages in
one deﬁnite cut-in-stone form – sorting out every detail. Members of the Ed-
itorial Team have indicated that Tolkien’s later manuscripts bear witness to
one last phase of intense experimentation, but apparently, no ﬁnal or deﬁnite
version of the language ever emerged. This was not necessarily a “failure”,
like a composer never managing to ﬁnish his great opera: “Unceasing change,
often frustrating to those who study these languages, was inherent in this
art,” Christopher Tolkien observes (SD:440). In another place, he remarks
regarding his father’s work on the languages that “it seems indeed that they
very attempt to write a deﬁnitive account produced immediate dissatisfac-
tion and the desire for new constructions: so the most beautiful manuscripts
28


were soon treated with disdain” (LR:342). Insofar as “delight lay in the cre-
ation itself”, Tolkien could not write a deﬁnitive account, or his fun would
be past and over.
Nonetheless, if compared to Tolkien’s intense experimentation in the twen-
ty years from 1915, Quenya does seem to have entered a somewhat “stable”
phase in the second half of the thirties. Over the next decade Tolkien wrote
LotR, which included some samples of Quenya as it now appeared (most
notably Nam´
ari¨
e). With the eventual publication of LotR in 1954–55, these
forms became a “ﬁxed” part of the mythos (despite Tolkien’s slight tinker-
ing in the 1966 revision). Having published LotR, Tolkien obviously could
not revise his languages anything as freely as he could before. Reportedly,
there are hints in his post-LotR manuscripts that he indeed felt somewhat
constrained. But this relative stability would later be good news for people
wanting to learn or study “the” Quenya, Tolkien’s more-or-less ﬁnal decision
on how this language had “really been” back in the remote ages chronicled
by his narratives.
Some (including me) have referred to this as mature Quenya. Others
feel this term to be unduly disparaging to the earlier forms of Quenya or
“Qenya”, since the inevitable implication is that they were somehow imma-
ture and inferior. Artistically, subjectively speaking I do think the “ﬁnal”
form of Quenya is more attractive than Tolkien’s earlier experiments, and
there can be no doubt that this is the kind of Quenya that most students
will primarily want to learn – not the earlier variants that Tolkien himself
rejected. For that matter, this is certainly the version of Quenya that Tolkien
himself would have wanted us to study; if it had been up to him, we would
never have seen any other versions! He took the utmost care to ensure that
his mythos would remain free from internal contradictions, and he would
never have recognized contradictory variants of Quenya as being somehow
equally valid. Indeed it should be noted that elderly Tolkien referred to his
earliest form of “Qenya” as “very primitive” (PM:379). Hence we have no
choice but to treat the early material with considerable caution, and there is
little reason to believe that Tolkien would have been greatly insulted if oth-
ers were to say (or indeed to agree!) that his early “Qenya” variants are not
quite as attractive as his later, carefully reﬁned version(s) of the language.
Even so, in this course I have opted to speak, not of “mature Quenya”, but
rather of LotR-style Quenya. The latter term must be wholly uncontrover-
sial. The language that this course teaches is of course LotR-style Quenya,
as well as it can be approximated at the present stage – but there is no
point in pretending that the various earlier “Qenya” variants never existed.
I will indeed refer to some of their features, to give the student some idea
of what kind of variations occur in the material. Apart from such academic
considerations, the early material is something we may “fall back on” where
material closer to (and ideally postdating) the writing of LotR is insuﬃcient
for our needs. In particular, we may cannibalize the “Qenya” material for
29


useful vocabulary items, in each case making sure that the words we carry
over into LotR-style Quenya ﬁt this tongue (i.e., they must not clash with
later words of diﬀerent meaning, and the shape of the words themselves
must ﬁt the phonology and derivational system of the language as Tolkien
eventually came to envision it). After all, all the incarnations of Q(u)enya in
the entire period from the language was invented in 1915 and until Tolkien’s
death in 1973 may well be seen as endless variations on somewhat the same
themes. Therefore it is in a way only ﬁtting that in our attempts to develop
a useable form of Quenya, we take everything into consideration. But as for
the overall grammatical and phonological structure, we must give priority
to Tolkien’s vision as it manifested in LotR and writings postdating this
work: If we have any respect whatsoever for Tolkien’s intentions, the form
of Quenya that we attempt to crystallize must be LotR-compatible.
Little can be easy or clear-cut in this strange corner of Language. Re-
constructing the structure of Quenya is like trying to piece together a huge
puzzle of far-sundered pieces. Many pieces are simply missing, vast amounts
of material being inaccessible to scholars (and to make matters worse, the
ones who are supposed to be publishing it often seem far more concerned
about concealing it). Moreover, because of Tolkien’s frequent revisions you
can’t even be sure that all the pieces you do ﬁnd belong to the same puzzle
at all. Some clearly do not ﬁt and can be ignored; many other fall in the
category of “doubtful”, and you don’t really know what to do with them.
In this course I will mention some of the variations and present my hope-
fully qualiﬁed guesses as to what we should accept as authoritative and
what is probably best ignored. Indeed, due to the general lack of explicit
grammatical information from Tolkien, I will not always present Quenya
grammar with conﬁdence and authority; rather you will often see me review
whatever evidence is available and try to make out some rules that we can
follow when putting together our own Quenya compositions. But in a way
this is precisely what I should like to do anyway, so as to acquaint students
with the kind of deductions that the ﬁeld of Tolkienian linguistics is all
about at this stage. Concerning some material I published earlier, I’ve had
(gentle) complaints to the eﬀect that I merely listed my conclusions without
showing what they were based on, somewhat dogmatically asserting that
“this is how it is, take my word for it”. I think this style was unavoidable
in a brief presentation, but here I will in many cases avail myself of the
opportunity to go back to the primary sources and really demonstrate what
kind of deductions underlie everything.
Precisely because Tolkien’s Quenya is a somewhat ﬂuid entity, ﬁxed in
general outline but with endless contradictory variations when it comes to
the details, we can to some extent feel free to crystallize our own standard
(not making it more diﬃcult than we have to). As long as we piece together
a usable system from elements Tolkien provided, even though there is no
way we can accept all the known variations within a single, uniﬁed system,
30


the resulting language will be “real Quenya” – to the extent such a thing
can exist.
0.5
Spelling conventions
Over the decades, Tolkien’s spelling of Quenya varied in certain details. As
discussed above, just about every aspect of Quenya was somewhat “vari-
able”, but unlike the unstable grammar, the spelling variations are not
very consequential: In theory our alphabet is not the writing native to
Quenya anyway. Tolkien was merely hesitating on how to best render into
our own letters the supposed “original Elvish script” (the Tengwar, also
called F¨
eanorian writing – a singularly beautiful script that Tolkien de-
vised with the same loving care as the languages themselves). In this course,
a consistent spelling has been imposed on the material, mostly based on
the spelling used in LotR (I say “mostly based” because the spelling used
in LotR is not entirely consistent either, but it is close!) Concerning the
spelling used in LotR, Tolkien wrote: “The archaic language of lore [namely
Quenya] is meant to be a kind of ‘Elven-latin’, and by transcribing it into
a spelling closely resembling that of Latin (except that y is only used as a
consonant, as y in E[nglish] Yes) the similarity to Latin has been increased
ocularly” (Letters:176).
I will outline the spelling conventions used in this work. What follows
is not something a fresh student needs to carefully internalize. People who
want to study Quenya should nonetheless be aware of the major spelling
inconsistencies in the primary sources. Guided primarily by the spelling
Tolkien used in LotR, I have regularized the following features:
Vowel length indicated by an accent (and no other symbol)
In his spelling of Quenya, Tolkien always used some kind of symbol to mark
vowels that are to be pronounced long (if you don’t know what a vowel is,
see the ﬁrst regular lesson). But precisely what symbol he used is some-
what variable. Sometimes he uses a macron, a short horizontal line above
the vowel; this is especially common in the Etymologies and certain other
“philological” writings. Sometimes a circumﬂex is used, e.g. ˆ
o in the word
fˆ
olima “secretive” from the earliest “Qenya” dictionary (LT2:340/QL:38).
But in LotR and most sources postdating it, Tolkien typically uses a nor-
mal accent to indicate vowel-length, and so will we here: long ´
a, ´
e, ´
ı, ´
o, ´
u
as opposed to short a, e, i, o, u. So if I ever needed the word fˆ
olima, I
would spell it f´
olima instead. When quoting Primitive Elvish forms, I will
however use circumﬂexes to mark long vowels. In the sources, macrons are
normally used instead: We have already quoted alk-w¯
a “swan” from the en-
try ´
alak in Etym., the macron above the ﬁnal a indicating that the vowel
is long. However, writing alk-wˆ
a (etc.) instead is safer in a document that
31


is to be distributed over the Internet; vowels with macrons may be replaced
by various weird symbols if the software of the recipients is not overly fond
of linguistics.
C rather than K
If you bothered looking up the reference I gave for the sentence Anar caluva
tielyanna above (Unﬁnished Tales p. 22), you may have noticed that in
the source, the middle word is actually spelt kaluva instead. In Quenya,
k and c represent the same sound (pronounced K); Tolkien just couldn’t
make up his mind which letter to use. In pre-LotR sources, such as the
Etymologies and the early Qenya Lexicon, he mostly used k (though in a few
cases, c pops up in these sources as well). Since the original inspiration for
Quenya was Finnish, and Finnish orthography employs the letter k, it is not
surprising that Tolkien originally preferred that grapheme. But as is evident
from Letters:176 quoted above, he later decided that in LotR, he would
spell Quenya as similar to Latin as possible. Guided by Latin orthography,
he started to use the letter c instead of k: “I decided to be ‘consistent’
and spell Elvish names and words throughout without k” (Letters:247). For
instance, the word for “metal” had been spelt tinko in the Etymologies
(entry tinkˆ
o), but in LotR Appendix E, the same word with the same
meaning appears as tinco instead. Hence we regularize k to c throughout.
It is a curious fact that Tolkien, even in sources that postdate LotR, in
many (indeed most) cases reverted to the use of k. His writings are quite
inconsistent on this point. A word for “Dwarf” is given as Kasar with a k in
WJ:388; yet on the next page Tolkien switches to c when quoting the Quenya
name of Moria: Casarrondo (“Dwarf-cave” or “Dwarf-hall”). A word for
“house” appears as k¨
oa in WJ:369 (k¨
oarya “his house”), but in MR:250
the same word is spelt with a c in the compound c¨
oacalina “light of the
house” (an Elvish expression for the soul inside the body). In some late notes
published in VT41:10, Tolkien mentioned a word ruskuite “foxy” using the
letter k rather than c, but immediately afterwards he wrote down a word
calarus “polished copper” using c rather than k. From the posthumously
published Silmarillion we remember names like Melkor and Tulkas, but in
MR:362, 382 the spellings used are Melcor and Tulcas. The Quenya word
for “horse” is spelt rocco in Letters:282, but in Letters:382 we have rokko
instead. Imitating Tolkien’s persistent indecision in this matter would be
quite pointless or even confusing. For instance, the Quenya word for “bed”
is given in LR:363 as kaima, but in Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR, the obviously related
word “lies” is spelt caita. Maintaining the inconsistent spelling out of some
kind of misunderstood reverence would obscure the relationship between the
words; to go with caita, the word for “bed” clearly ought to be spelt caima.
I should mention that there are those who would regularize the material to
k instead, discarding the spellings used in LotR in favour of the orthography
32


Tolkien uses in many other sources. This is only a matter of taste, and in
the “C or K” question all writers can essentially make their own choice, but
I will normally adhere to the LotR spelling. After all, the LotR is a rather
central work regarding the setting Tolkien placed his languages in.
NOTE: But in the case of the title of the Markirya poem, I tend to retain k simply
because the word markirya or “ark” only occurs in the early, “Qenya” version of the
poem. It is not found in the later Quenya version, though I don’t know what we should
otherwise call it. So in this case I will leave the k in to mark this as an early “Qenya” word,
though a form marcirya would surely work in LotR-style Quenya as well – and this is
the spelling I would use if I ever needed the word “ark” in an actual Quenya text. I guess
I would normally also retain k in some names that we are very familiar with from the
Silmarillion: Melkor, Tulkas, Kement´
ari and a few others. But the Silmarillion also
employs forms like Calaquendi (rather than Kalaquendi), so there is little consistency
in this work.
QU rather than just Q
In most pre-LotR sources, the combination “cw” is represented by the one
letter q. But in a few early sources (published only posthumously), and more
importantly in LotR, Tolkien used qu rather than just q: Again the inspi-
ration was Latin spelling. This even aﬀected the name of the language; as
mentioned above, Tolkien’s original spelling was Qenya. To quote another
example, the word for “feather”, spelt qesse in a pre-LotR source (Etym.,
entry kwes), became quesse in LotR (Appendix E). This is a change that
is consistently carried through in Tolkien’s post-LotR writings as far as we
know them, so we need not hesitate to impose this spelling on the earlier
material as well. (Tolkien’s own son does so in LT1:170; when discussing the
ﬁrst element of the name Qerkaringa occurring in early material, Christo-
pher Tolkien uses the spelling querka instead. I would go one step further
and write querca.)
X rather than KS (or for that matter CS)
Tolkien’s spelling of what is to be pronounced “ks” varies. Most sources seem
to have ks, but occasionally, the spelling x is used instead (already in the
Qenya Lexicon of ca. 1915, p. 95, we seem to have tuxa as a variant spelling
of tuksa “144”). Throughout the Etymologies, the spelling ks is used, e.g.
maksa “pliant, soft” (entry masag). The Etymologies, entry karak, thus
gives Helkarakse as the name of the arctic area crossed by some of the
Noldor when they went into exile. However, this name appears as Helcarax¨
e
in the published Silmarillion, with x for ks (and c for k), and we regularize
in accordance with the latter spelling – e.g. maxa rather than maksa. In
published post-LotR sources, Tolkien seems to be using x rather than ks
consistently, e.g. axan “commandment” and nixe “frost” in WJ:399/417,
33


or axo “bone” in MC:223 – so x must be seen as his ﬁnal decision in this
matter. In LotR Appendix E, Tolkien refers to “the combinations ts, ps, ks
(x), that were favoured in Quenya”; this also seems to suggest that ks is
to be represented by x in normal spelling. (No actual example of a Quenya
word containing x/ks seems to occur in LotR, but as mentioned above, we
have Helcarax¨
e in the Silmarillion.)
N rather than ˜
N
In many sources, Tolkien uses the symbol ˜
n, which should not be pronounced
as in Spanish orthography (e.g., as in se˜
nor). “In the transcription ˜
n [is
used for] the F¨
eanorian letter for the back nasal, the ng of king” (MR:350).
Unlike English, Quenya could originally have this ng at the beginning of
words (as well as in other positions where it may also occur in English). A
prominent example is the word ˜
Noldo, plural ˜
Noldor, which is so spelt in
many sources. But in LotR Appendix E, Tolkien wrote that this ng or ˜
n
“has been transcribed n (as in Noldo) according to the pronunciation in the
Third Age”. The list of Tengwar names in the same Appendix conﬁrms the
development Tolkien hinted at here: the pronunciation of certain symbols of
Tengwar writing was slightly changed as the long Ages of Middle-earth went
by. The letters that were originally called ngoldo and ngwalme (= ˜
noldo,
˜
nwalme) were later called noldo and nwalme instead; since the letters were
named after actual Quenya words containing the sound denoted by the letter,
this reﬂects a development whereby initial ˜
n- becomes normal n-. Already in
the Etymologies of the mid-thirties, Tolkien hinted at a similar development:
In the entry ˜
ngar(a)m, the word for “wolf” was listed as “˜
narmo, narmo”,
which is evidently to be understood as an older and a later form. MR:350
mentions a word ˜
n´
ol¨
e “lore, knowledge” that is spelt with initial ˜
n- in the
Etymologies as well (entry ˜
ngol, where it is glossed “wisdom”), but in the
Silmarillion Appendix (entry gˆ
ul) it is spelt n´
ol¨
e. This would be the later,
Third Age form. We go for the Third Age form everywhere, regularizing ˜
n
to n throughout. (Notice, though, that in Tengwar writing the distinction
between the symbols transcribed ˜
n and n was upheld even after they had
both come to be pronounced “n”. But this is not a problem as long as we
write Quenya in our normal alphabet.) Undoubtedly the combinations ng
and nc in the middle of words are also technically ˜
ng and ˜
nc, as in anga
“iron” or anca “jaw”, but this pronuncation comes naturally to speakers of
English and does not have to be expressly represented in writing. As far as
is known, Tolkien never used the letter ˜
n before g or c in Quenya words,
but only n.
34


S rather than Þ
This is a case somewhat similar to ˜
n vs. n: Tolkien imagined that Quenya as
spoken in Valinor possessed þ, more or less like the sound spelt th in English
think. (In Valinorean Quenya it was strictly a little more s-like than the
English sound, pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the upper teeth
only, not between the upper and lower teeth as in English.) However, in the
dialect of the Noldor, this s-like þ eventually turned into normal s, merging
with preexisting s’es (a change F¨
eanor vehemently but vainly opposed: see
PM:331–339 for an eminent example of how intertwined Tolkien’s languages
and narratives can be). Quenya as a ceremonial language in Middle-earth
always had s, since only the Noldorin dialect was known there. In WJ:484,
Tolkien mentions þinde as the Quenya word for “grey, pale or silvery grey”,
but adds that in the Noldorin (“˜
N”) dialect, this became sinde. In WJ:319,
we ﬁnd þelma as a word for “ﬁxed idea, will”; in this case the later Noldorin
form selma is not mentioned there or elsewhere, but we would still use the
latter form here, since we are aiming for the kind of Quenya that was used
in Middle-earth in the Third Age.
The diaeresis
In many cases, Tolkien adds a diaeresis, two dots, above a vowel, for in-
stance ¨
a, ¨
o, ¨
e in the names E¨
arendil, E¨
onw¨
e. This is only to clarify the
pronunciation, primarily for readers used to English orthography. It should
be emphasized that the diaeresis is not in any way “necessary” to write cor-
rect Quenya. Tolkien wrote about the spelling ¨
e that it is “only a device of
transcription, not needed in the original” – that is, in the supposed “origi-
nal” Tengwar writing (PM:343). It is not really “needed” in the transcription
either – Tolkien never used it in the Etymologies – and it can safely be left
out in e-mail. Indeed some scholars advocate leaving it out altogether in all
media, perceiving it as a superﬂuous graphic encumbrance useful only to
people who don’t know the ﬁrst thing about Quenya (and to people used to
the orthographies of such languages as German, Swedish or Finnish, it can
be downright misleading). But I don’t know; I guess I like to see the diaere-
sis in carefully presented texts, even if it doesn’t tell me anything I don’t
know beforehand. It adds an exotic tint to the texts, and also represents a
nod in the direction of the visual impression made by written Finnish, since
Finnish orthography employs letters like ¨
a and ¨
o – that however denote
sounds distinct from normal a, o, which is not the case in Quenya spelling.
If we are to use the diaeresis, it should however be used in a consistent way.
In WJ:425, Christopher Tolkien comments on his father’s “very variable”
use of it, so some regularization is required. (Christopher Tolkien himself
has been regularizing his father’s spelling in some quotations; for instance,
in PM:371 he cites the Quenya word ross¨
e “ﬁne rain, dew” from the entry
35


ros1 in Etym., but there the word is actually spelt rosse with no diaeresis.)
The ﬁnal -¨
e in (say) E¨
onw¨
e is meant to remind the reader that ﬁnal -¨
e is
not silent, as it usually is in English orthography. “Final e is never mute or a
mere sign of length as in English,” Tolkien noted in LotR Appendix E (this
very sentence providing two examples of this feature of English spelling,
namely mute and mere). He added that “to mark this ﬁnal e is often (but
not consistently) written ¨
e ”. As he says, this spelling is not used consistently,
whether in LotR or in other sources – cf. some of the words already quoted:
quesse, sinde, nixe. Hereinafter, we will however be consistent about this:
quess¨
e, sind¨
e, nix¨
e. (Notice, however, that the diaeresis is not used in
words where the ﬁnal e is also the only vowel, as in short words like te
“them” or ve “as, like” – both of which occur in LotR. From time to time I
see some overeager dot-fan produce spellings like t¨
e and v¨
e, but while this
is not in any way “harmful”, it is quite superﬂuous: Tolkien never uses such
spellings.)
Since only a ﬁnal -e receives the diaeresis, the dots normally go if you add
an ending to the word (or use it as the ﬁrst element in a compound), since the
-e is then no longer ﬁnal. An attested example of this is provided by the word
l´
amaty´
av¨
e “sound-taste” (individual pleasure in wordforms), the plural of
which is spelt l´
amaty´
aver (MR:215–216). We do not see **l´
amaty´
av¨
er,
for because of the plural ending -r, the vowel e before it is not ﬁnal anymore.
(Throughout this course, a double asterisk ** is used to mark a wrong form.)
Appendix D in LotR likewise indicates that the plural form of enqui¨
e (the
Eldarin six-day week) is to be spelt enquier rather than **enqui¨
er.
Besides ﬁnal ¨
e, we shall use the diaeresis to clarify the pronunciation of
the combinations ea, eo and oe (sc. to indicate that both vowels are to be
pronounced clearly separate: e-a, e-o, o-e; hence for instance ¨
ea is not to
be drawn together like ea in English heart). In the case of e + a and e +
o, the diaeresis is placed above the e as long as it appears as a lower-case
letter: ¨
ea, ¨
eo. If, however, it is to be capitalized, the dots move to the next
letter instead: E¨
a, E¨
o (as in E¨
arendil, E¨
onw¨
e). Tolkien’s own writings are
not consistent in this matter; we adopt the spelling used in LotR and the
Silmarillion. Sometimes he places the diaeresis above a capital letter as well;
for instance, the Quenya name of the universe in some texts appears as ¨
Ea
(e.g. MR:7), though according to the system we just sketched it should be E¨
a
– as in the published Silmarillion. (Gross inconsistency is seen in Letters:386,
where Tolkien refers to “the attempt of E¨
arendil to cross ¨
Ear [the ocean]” –
it must be either ¨
Earendil, ¨
Ear OR E¨
arendil, E¨
ar!) Conversely, Tolkien
sometimes places the diaeresis over the second vowel in the group even when
the ﬁrst vowel is not capitalized, resulting in spellings like e¨
a (UT:305, 317);
we would rather spell it ¨
ea (as Tolkien himself did elsewhere; see VT39:6). In
a footnote in MR:206, Christopher Tolkien observes that his father wavered
between F¨
ean´
aro and Fe¨
an´
aro (the Quenya form of the name F¨
eanor);
according to the system here outlined, it should be F¨
ean´
aro.
36


In the case of oe (a very rare combination), we place the diaeresis over the
¨
e, as in the example lo¨
end¨
e in LotR Appendix D (this is the name of the
middle day of the year in the calendar of the Elves). In Appendix E, Tolkien
explicitly stated that the fact that oe is disyllabic is “often indicated by
writing . . . o¨
e ”.
In some sources, the combination ie is also broken up with a diaeresis,
resulting in spellings like Ni¨
enna (name of a Vali¨
e or “goddess”), for in-
stance in MR:49. Yet this spelling is not used in the published Silmarillion,
that simply has Nienna. The LotR itself is somewhat ambiguous on this
point. In Appendix A we have the names Telperi¨
en and Silmari¨
en so spelt
(though Unﬁnished Tales p. 173 has Silmarien). However, the most sub-
stantial Quenya text in LotR, Nam´
ari¨
e, does not use the diaeresis in this
combination – this text has tier, not ti¨
er, for “paths” (though the latter
spelling occurs in RGEO:67). In accordance with this example, as well as
Nienna in the Silmarillion, we will not use the diaeresis in the combination
ie. If, however, the group -ie occurs at the end of a word, the e receives
the diaeresis because it is ﬁnal (wholly irrespective of the fact that it is also
part of the combination ie), in accordance with the rule established above.
Hence Nam´
ari¨
e, Vali¨
e rather than Nam´
arie, Valie, and if the ﬁrst ele-
ment of Nienna occurs by itself, we will spell it ni¨
e – this is the word for
“tear”. Removing the plural ending -r from tier “paths” likewise produces
ti¨
e “path”, since -¨
e becomes ﬁnal.
In many post-LotR sources, Tolkien also started to break up the combi-
nation oa by means of a diaeresis (apparently to warn the reader that “oa”
is not drawn together as in English load). Hence we have spellings like hr¨
oa
“body” (MR:350 and passim). Cf. also some of the words quoted above:
k¨
oarya, c¨
oacalina. However, in LotR Tolkien simply wrote oa. Contrast
the spelling loa used in LotR (Appendix D: “The Eldar also observed a
short period or solar year . . . usually called loa”) with the spelling l¨
oa in
MR:426 (where the word occurs in the plural: “l¨
oar upon l¨
oar” = years
upon years). Regularizing in accordance with the system used in LotR, we
will not use the diaeresis in the combination oa. Hence we will here use
spellings like hroa “body”, coa “house” etc. Hroa without a diaeresis is
actually found in MR:399–400 (and VT41:13), so we are not “tampering”
with Tolkien’s spelling, just crystallizing a standard by choosing one of the
options his writings provide and carrying it through consistently. This, as I
have tried to demonstrate, is true of all the regularization I impose on the
material.
[As for the English orthography employed in this work, it follows the author’s home-
made Mid-Atlantic convention. Therefore you will ﬁnd British spellings like ﬂavour, colour
(not American ﬂavor, color) next to American spellings like analyze (not British analyse).
The orthography of my native Norwegian does not in all cases match the pronunciation,
but it comes rather closer to the spoken language than any variant of English spelling
37


does. Therefore, please allow me to gently mock the pointless variations introduced by well-
meaning reformers of English orthography. It is actually beyond help, so why bother?]

Lesson 1
The sounds of Quenya.
Pronunciation and accentuation.
1.1
General remarks
Quenya as an actual entity in our own world exists primarily as a writ-
ten language: Quenya enthusiasts tend to be widely scattered and must
generally share their compositions via some written medium only (indeed
I shall normally refer to users of Quenya as “writers” rather than “speak-
ers”). Nonetheless, any student should obviously know what pronunciation
Tolkien imagined, as well as his intentions can be approximated now.
There exist a very few recordings of Tolkien himself reading Quenya texts.
In a late TV interview, Tolkien writes out and pronounces the greeting elen
s´
ıla l´
umenn’ omentielvo. More notably, he made two diﬀerent recordings
of Nam´
ari¨
e (sung and spoken). The spoken version is also available on the
net:
http://www.salon.com/audio/2000/10/05/tolkien elvish/index.html
(under “Poem in Elvish”). A few lines of this version of Nam´
ari¨
e diﬀer
from their LotR counterparts: The recorded version has inyar ´
un´
oti nar
ve r´
amar aldaron / inyar ve lint¨
e yulmar v´
anier instead of y´
eni
´
un´
otim¨
e ve r´
amar aldaron! / y´
eni ve lint¨
e yuldar (a)v´
anier as in
LotR. The recording was made before the book was published (and hence
before the ﬁnal revisions). A much later recording, with the same text as in
the book, also exists. I have not heard it, so I cannot comment further.
The very few extant recordings are interesting, but they are not our chief
source of information. Most of what we know about Quenya pronuncia-
tion is based on Tolkien’s written notes about how his languages should be
pronounced, predominantly the information provided in LotR Appendix E.
(Indeed Tolkien’s actual pronunciation in the recordings is not always quite
ﬂawless according to his own technical descriptions, but then he was not a
native speaker of Quenya.)
Any natural language has a phonology, a set of rules deﬁning what sounds
are used, how they vary and behave, and how they can be combined. This
goes for any well-made invented language as well. Quenya is most deﬁnitely
39


not a haphazard jumble of sounds; Tolkien carefully constructed its phonol-
ogy – both as an evolving entity (classical Quenya gradually developing from
Primitive Elvish) and as a “ﬁxed” form (deﬁning the kind of Quenya that
was used as a language of lore and ceremony in Middle-earth). Tolkien had
Pengolodh, the sage of Gondolin, observe that Elvish tongues tended to use
relatively few sounds – “for the Eldar being skilled in craft are not wasteful
nor prodigal to small purpose, admiring in a tongue rather the skilled and
harmonious use of a few well-balanced sounds than profusion ill-ordered”
(PM:398). None of the sounds used in Quenya are particularly exotic from a
European viewpoint, but they are combined in an exquisitely tidy manner.
Compared to Tolkien’s Elvish, many “real” languages indeed appear rather
messy.
1.2
Basic terms
Let us get some basic terms into place (people with linguistic training need
not spend much time on this section). The sounds of any language can be
divided into two broad categories, vowels and consonants. The vowels are
sounds made by letting the air stream “freely” through the mouth: Diﬀerent
vowels are produced by modifying the position of the tongue and the lips, but
the stream of air is not directly obstructed. If one draws out various vowels,
pronouncing aaaaa. . . or eeeee. . . or ooooo. . . , it is easy to feel how the
air streams quite unhindered though the mouth: One merely conﬁgures the
tongue and lips to “shape” the desired sound. Vowels can be more or less
“open” or “closed”: You only have to notice the position of the tongue and
lower jaw when pronouncing aaah. . . as contrasted with their position when
you pronounce ooooh. . . to understand what is meant by this. The vowel
a (as in English part) is the most open, while the vowel u (as in English
rude) is the most closed. Other vowels fall between. Vowels can also be more
or less “rounded”, mainly depending on the position of the lips; the vowel
u (as just described) is said to be rounded because it is pronounced with
the lips pouted. A vowel like o (as in English sore) is actually pronounced
much like the a of part, but o is rounded and a is not – making the vowels
audibly distinct.
When pronouncing vowels, the stream of air is only modiﬁed (by means
of devices like the ones just described). It is never actually “hindered”. In
the case of the consonants, the air is however more actively obstructed.
Thus, Tolkien can inform us that one early Elvish term for consonant was
tapta tengw¨
e or just tapta, meaning “impeded element” or “impeded
one” (VT39:7). In the most “extreme” cases the stream of air may even
be completely halted for a moment: This is easily perceived in the case of
a consonant like p, which is pronounced by bringing the lips into contact,
momentarily cutting oﬀthe stream of air from the lungs and allowing a
40


pressure to build up inside the mouth. Then the lips are suddenly parted
again, releasing the air in a small explosion – and this explosion constitutes
a p. Such plosive consonants include t, p, k and their counterparts d, b, g
(sc. hard g as in gold, not as in gin). They are all formed by halting and then
suddenly releasing the air various places in the mouth. Instead of halting
the air completely one may also let it “ﬁzzle through” a small opening, as
when f is pronounced by forcing the air out between the lower lip and the
upper teeth; such “friction” sounds are called fricatives (or spirants) and
include consonants like f, th, v. And there are yet other options on how
to manipulate the stream of air, such as rerouting it through the nose to
produce nasal consonants like n or m.
The concept of voicing should also be understood. Humans (and, it would
seem, Elves) come with a kind of buzzing device installed in their throats,
namely the vocal chords. By making the vocal chords vibrate, one may add
“voice” to the stream of air before it enters the speech organs proper. The
presence or lack of such voicing is what distinguishes sounds like v vs. f.
If one draws out a sound like ffff. . . and suddenly turns it into vvvv. . .
instead, one will feel the “buzzer” in the throat kicking in (put a ﬁnger on
your glottis – what in men is called the “Adam’s apple”, less protuberant
in women – and you will actually feel the vibration of the vocal chords).
In principle, the device of voicing could be used to double the number of
sounds we are able to produce, since they could all be pronounced either
with vibration in the vocal chords (as voiced sounds) or without such vi-
bration (as unvoiced sounds). In practice, most of the sounds of speech do
not appear in unvoiced versions. Many sounds would barely be perceptible
without the voicing (n, for instance, would be reduced to little more than a
weak snort). Normally all vowels are voiced as well, certainly so in Quenya
(though in Japanese, vowels may lose their voicing in certain environments).
But I have already referred to d, b, g as the “counterparts” of t, p, k; they
are counterparts in the sense that the former are voiced and the latter are
not. One characteristic feature of Quenya (at least the Noldorin dialect) is
the very limited distribution of the voiced plosives d, b, g; they occur solely
in the middle of words, and then only as part of the consonant clusters
nd/ld/rd, mb, and ng. Some speakers also pronounced lb instead of lv.
(Possibly Tolkien imagined diﬀerent rules for the poorly attested Vanyarin
dialect of Quenya: The Silmarillion refers to a lament called Aldud´
eni¨
e
made by a Vanyarin Elf; this word has puzzled researchers since the middle
d occurs in a position that would be quite impossible in Noldorin Quenya.)
Syllables: Made up of vowels and consonants, speech is not an undiﬀerenti-
ated outburst of sound. Rather it is perceived to be organized into rhythmic
units called syllables. The shortest possible words are necessarily monosyl-
labic, having only one syllable – like English from or its Quenya equivalent
ho. Words of more than one syllable, polysyllabic ones, form longer strings of
rhythmic “beats”. A word like faster has two syllables (fas-ter), a word like
41


wonderful has three (won-der-ful), a word like geography has four (ge-og-
ra-phy), and so on – though obviously we can’t go much further before the
words would be felt to be impractically long and diﬃcult to pronounce. Some
oriental languages, like Vietnamese, show a great preference for monosyllabic
words. But as is evident from the English examples just quoted, European
languages often employ longer words, and Tolkien’s Quenya makes extensive
use of big mouthfuls (as does Finnish). Consider words like Ainulindal¨
e or
Silmarillion (ﬁve syllables: ai-nu-lin-da-l¨
e, sil-ma-ril-li-on). An unin-
ﬂected Quenya word typically has two or three syllables, and this number is
often increased by adding inﬂectional endings, or by compounding.
1.3
The sounds of Quenya
In Quenya, the basic vowels are a, e, i, o, u (short and long). They may
also be combined into diphthongs, groups of two basic vowels pronounced
together as one syllable: There are three diphthongs in -i (ai, oi, ui) and
three in -u (au, eu, iu, though the diphthongs eu and iu are quite rare).
The consonants of Third Age Quenya may be listed as c (= k), d, f, g, gw,
h, hy, hw, l, ly, m, n, nw, ny, p, qu, r, ry, s, t, ty, v, y and w (this
listing is not wholly uncontroversial; the consonant system of Quenya can be
plausibly analyzed in more than one way). In Elvish writing, the Tengwar
orthography also upholds the distinction between some consonants that by
the Third Age had come to be pronounced alike and thus merged altogether
(þ merging with s, while initial ˜
n fell together with n – see the discussion
of spelling conventions). In the transcription and spelling employed in this
course, the former presence of “lost” distinct consonants is reﬂected in two
cases only: hl and hr, that were originally unvoiced l and r, but later they
merged with normal l, r (and are therefore not included on the list of Third
Age Quenya consonants above). Thus we will spell, say, hr´
ıv¨
e (“winter”)
in this way despite the fact that Tolkien imagined the typical Third Age
pronunciation to be simply “r´
ıv¨
e” (with a normal r).
Though the consonants hy, gw, hw, ly, nw, ny, ry, ty, and qu (and hr,
hl) must here be written as two letters (as digraphs), they should evidently
be taken as unitary sounds: Their pronunciation will be discussed in greater
detail below. The digraphs in -w represent labialized consonants, while the
digraphs in -y stand for palatalized consonants; again, see below for further
discussion of these terms. It should be understood that qu is simply an
aesthetic way of spelling what would otherwise be represented as cw (most
people will agree that Quenya looks better than Cwenya), so qu, like
nw, is a labialized consonant. When counting syllables one must remember
that there is no actual vowel u in qu; “u” here stands for w. A word like
alqua (“swan”) thus has only two syllables: al-qua (= al-cwa). One must
not think “al-qu-a” and conclude that there are actually three syllables. In
42


Tengwar writing, qu is denoted by a single letter, and in most early sources,
Tolkien also used the single letter q to represent it.
Double consonants: Some consonants also occur in long or double versions;
double vs. single consonants may be compared to long vs. short vowels. The
“obvious” cases, sc. the double consonants directly represented in orthogra-
phy, are cc, ll, mm, nn, pp, rr, ss and tt (e.g. ecco “spear”, colla “cloak”,
lamma “sound”, anna “gift”, lappa “hem of robe”, yarra- “to growl”,
ess¨
e “name”, atta “two”). The group pp is very rare, only attested in ma-
terial far predating the LotR. In the Note on Pronunciation appended to
the Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien noted: “Consonants written twice are
pronounced long, thus Yavanna has the long n heard in English unnamed,
penknife, not the short n in unaimed, penny.” Words like tana “that” vs.
tanna “sign”, tyel¨
e “ceases” vs. tyell¨
e “grade”, ata “again” vs. atta “two”
should be audibly distinct. – It is possible that some of the consonants writ-
ten as digraphs must also be counted as double consonants when they occur
between vowels; e.g. ny = long or double palatalized n (more on this below).
Consonant clusters (vs. single consonants): It is diﬃcult to pronounce
many sequential consonants, so the languages of the word generally con-
ﬁne themselves to relatively small groups (or “clusters”) of consonants. The
most typical word, from just about any language, is a series of vowels and
consonants (single ones or relatively short consonant clusters) alternating –
the “core” of each syllable usually being a vowel. Tolkien’s Quenya is no ex-
ception; this language actually has quite restrictive rules for how consonants
and vowels can be combined into syllables and longer words. Even so, con-
sonant clusters are quite common, but they are not distributed as “freely”
as in English. While English and for that matter Sindarin allow consonant
clusters at the beginning of words, Quenya does not (SD:417–418). A word
like scream, commencing with a cluster of no less than three consonants,
would be quite impossible in Quenya. Tolkien noted that the name that the
“Woses” or Wild Men had for themselves, Drughu, was adapted to Quenya
as R´
u (UT:385). Quenya could not preserve the initial cluster dr- of the orig-
inal form of this loan-word (even apart from the fact that Quenya could not
have d in this position). Quenya does allow a limited number of consonant
clusters medially, between vowels in the middle of words; among “frequent”
of “favoured” clusters Tolkien cited ld, mb, mp, nc, nd, ng, ngw, nqu,
nt, ps, ts and x (for cs). Hence we have such typical Quenya-style words as
Elda “Elf”, lamb¨
e “tongue”, tumpo “hump”, ranco “arm” etc. Finally,
at the end of words, only ﬁve single consonants may occur: only -l, -n, -r,
-s, or -t is permitted in this position (Letters:425; however, most Quenya
words end in a vowel). Consonant clusters or double consonants are not nor-
mally found at the end of words, though they may occur if a ﬁnal vowel
drops out (is elided) because the next word begins in the same or a similar
vowel. Hence in LotR we have a “ﬁnal” nn in the phrase l´
umenn’ omen-
tielvo (“on the hour of our meeting”), but only because this is reduced from
43


l´
umenna omentielvo (this full form occurring in WJ:367 and Letters:424).
The only genuine consonant cluster occurring at the end of a word seems
to be nt used a speciﬁc grammatical ending (dual dative, to be discussed
in later lessons) – e.g. ciryant “for a couple of ships”, formed from cirya
“ship”. Tolkien’s earliest “Qenya” experiments, as recorded in the Qenya
Lexicon of 1915, were more liberal in this respect. “Qenya” allowed more
ﬁnal consonants and even ﬁnal consonant clusters, but as LotR-style Quenya
evolved in Tolkien’s notes, he tightened up the phonology. Thus he gave the
language a more clearly deﬁned ﬂavour.
1.4
Pronunciation
Vowels: Quenya vowels are pure. For people who want to pronounce Elvish
vowels with some degree of accuracy, Tolkien recommended Italian vowels as
a model (as did Zamenhof for Esperanto, by the way). Speakers of English
have an ingrained habit of blurring many vowels, especially when they are
not fully stressed; hence in a word like banana it is typically only the middle
A that comes out as a “proper” A-sound. The two other A’s, that are not
stressed, are typically made to sound like a blurred, obscure “reduction
vowel” that linguists call a schwa (from a Hebrew word for nothingness;
English textbooks sometimes prefer the spelling “shwa”). But in Quenya
all vowels, in all positions, must be clearly and distinctly pronounced; any
tendencies to “blur” them must be strongly resisted.
As we remember, Quenya has both long and short vowels, the long ones
being marked with an accent: ´
a, ´
e, ´
o, ´
u, ´
ı vs. short a, e, o, u, i. Long and
short vowels must be kept apart and pronounced clearly distinct. Sometimes
vowel length is the only thing that makes otherwise similar words distinct:
for instance, cu with a short u means “dove”, whereas c´
u with a long ´
u
means “crescent”.
Long ´
a can be sounded as in English father: m´
a “hand”, n´
ar¨
e “ﬂame”,
qu´
aco “crow”. However, English does not have anything corresponding to
Quenya short a. It is absolutely necessary to master it, for short a is by
far the commonest of Quenya vowels. Tolkien noted that it should be more
“open” than the long ´
a. What we want is a vowel that by its sound (or
quality) is about midway between the a’s of English father and English cat
– but as for its length (or quantity), it should by all means be short as in the
latter word. The vowel heard in Spanish padre will do. Speakers of English
may pin down a short a by isolating the ﬁrst part of the diphthong ai as in
aisle.
NOTE: If you have the original Star Wars movie available, listen carefully when Har-
rison Ford ﬁrst appears about 45 minutes in and introduces himself as “Han Solo”: Ford
actually produces a nice Quenya-style short a in “Han”, making this syllable sound as it
would in Quenya words (e.g. hanu “a male” or handa “intelligent”; apparently there is
44


even a Quenya word han “beyond”). But later in the SW movies, the vowel of “Han” is
inconsistently pronounced either with a long a as in English father or with the vowel heard
in English cat, which is precisely the vowel to be avoided in Quenya. Linguistic consistency
was never the, ahem, force of Star Wars. By the way, do you remember Endor, the green
moon where George Lucas placed his reinvented teddy bears in the third movie? Guess
what the Quenya word for “Middle-earth” is! Lucas would surely say that his intention
was to pay tribute to Tolkien. . .
UPDATED NOTE: Now that Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship of the Ring has appeared,
I can quote examples from the soundtrack of this movie as well; most people interested in
Tolkien’s work will surely have seen it, and many are also going to buy it on video or DVD.
Good examples of short Elvish a occur in the Sindarin name Caradhras “Redhorn” as
pronounced by Christopher Lee (“Saruman”) in the scene where his spying crows return
to Isengard: “So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. . . ” Lee also gets the
short a’s more or less right in a scene following shortly afterwards, when he stands on the
top of Isengard reading a Quenya invocation: Nai yarvax¨
ea rasselya taltuva notto-
carinnar. . . (but the last word sounds almost like c´
arinnar, the ﬁrst vowel being long –
after all, Chris Lee is not a native speaker of Quenya!)
An extra challenge for speakers of English is to pronounce -a as a full
vowel at the end of words. Where English orthography has a ﬁnal -a, it
is normally pronounced like a schwa. Contrast the English and the Spanish
pronunciation of the ﬁnal vowel in a name like Sara; in Spanish, the English-
style reduction or “blurring” of the -a does not take place. In one very
early source, Tolkien actually stated that “Qenya”, like English, turned ﬁnal,
unaccented -a into a schwa (“as in English drama”, QL:9), but there is
nothing to suggest that this idea was still valid decades later when he wrote
the LotR. Indeed even the early source just referred to has it that there
was one important dialect of “Qenya” where the weakening of ﬁnal -a did
not take place. So speakers should try to pronounce a full a in all positions:
neither of the a’s in a word like anna “gift” should be pronounced as in the
English name Anna.
Long ´
e is another Quenya sound that does not occur in contemporary
English. The long e of English became long i (like Quenya ´
ı) centuries ago
– though because of this descent it is still often spelt ee, as in see. Quenya ´
e
has the value of German eh as in Mehr. The pronunciation of ai in English
air at least approaches ´
e, but this is really a short e followed by a schwa.
Tolkien notes that long ´
e should be closer than short e (see LotR Appendix
E), so just lengthening the vowel heard in English end will not be quite
suﬃcient. The quality of the vowel should be about midway between the
vowels heard in English end and English see, but it should be long like the
latter: n´
en “water”, r´
e “day”, m´
ena “region”.
Short e may be pronounced as in English end. In Quenya this sound also
occurs in ﬁnal position. Since word-ﬁnal e is usually silent in English orthog-
raphy, Tolkien often used the spelling ¨
e in this position – and throughout
this course, this spelling is employed consistently. This is only to remind
45


English readers that in Quenya, this letter is to be distinctly pronounced.
But since word-ﬁnal e never occurs in spoken English, some speakers tend to
substitute i or ey (following English practice in the rare cases of a ﬁnal or-
thographic “e” being sounded, as when Jesse is pronounced “jessi”, or karate
is pronounced “karatey”). Quenya e should have the value described above
in all positions. It must NOT be pronounced i, nor must there be a y-like
sound creeping after it: l´
om¨
e “night”, mor¨
e “black”, tinw¨
e “sparkle”.
Long ´
ı is pronounced as in English machine, that same as “ee” in English
see: the Quenya word s´
ı (“now”) is similar in sound. Other examples include
n´
ıs “woman” and r´
ıma “edge”. This long ´
ı must be noticeably longer than
short i, which may be pronounced like in English pit: Titta “tiny”, imb¨
e
”between”, vinya “new”. In one early source, Tolkien himself quoted the
word pit as an example of short “Qenya” i (QL:8). Later writings suggest
that the quality of the vowel-sound should be like the i of machine, in English
often spelt “ee” – start with this sound and shorten it. (Before unvoiced
stops, as in feet, “ee” may be quite short also in English – just make sure
there is a distinction of length between i and ´
ı.) Notice that i is never
pronounced ai as in English ﬁne = “fain”. (Quenya ﬁn¨
e “larch” has two
syllables, the vowels being those heard in pit [ideally a little closer] and pet,
respectively.) Of course, this also goes for ﬁnal -i (usually a plural ending).
If the student will forgive another Star Wars reference, George Lucas’ Jedi
may be “jedai” = “jed-eye”, but Tolkien’s Quendi are most deﬁnitely not
“quendai”. In Quenya, ﬁnal -i should rather be pronounced as in Iraqi,
Mississippi.
Long ´
o may be pronounced more or less as in English sore, but preferably a
little tenser and “closer” (midway between the vowel-sounds of English sore
and English “oo” as in soon): m´
ol “slave”, t´
o “wool”, ´
oma “voice”. Short
o may be pronounced as in English for (when accented), or as in box. The
quality of the latter vowel may be just a little too open and A-like according
to Tolkien’s descriptions. Yet this is the pronunciation he himself used in
most cases in the recording of him reading Nam´
ari¨
e; it should perhaps be
attributed to his English accent. Some words with o: rondo “cave”, olos
“dream”, tolto “eight”. Of course, Quenya o is never pronounced “ow” as in
English so, also; a word like tolto must NOT come out as “tol-tow”. Neither
must o ever be reduced to a schwa or dropped altogether; be especially
mindful of the ending -on, often found in masculine names (and also in plural
genitives like Silmarillion; see later lessons). “English-style” pronunciation
of a name like Sauron would result in what a baﬄed Elf might try to
represent in writing as S´
or’n (or at best S´
oren). The ﬁnal -on should
sound rather like the ﬁrst syllable of English online, with the vowel fully
intact even though it is unaccented in Sauron. In the Jackson movie, the
actors usually deliver a good pronunciation of this name; especially listen
to how “Gandalf” and “Saruman” pronounce it. Good examples of short
Elvish o also occur in the name Mordor as pronounced by the same two
46


actors.
Long ´
u is the vowel of English brute, in English often spelt “oo” as in fool:
N´
umen “west”, c´
u “crescent”, y´
uyo “both”. It must be distinctly longer
than short u, which is pronounced somewhat like the vowel of English put
(NOT like in English cut). Ideally, Quenya short u should be a little more
“rounded” than the vowel of put; it should be simply a shorter version of the
long ´
u or “oo” described above: Cundu ”prince”, nuru “death”, ulundo
“monster”. Notice that Quenya u is never pronounced “yu” as in English
union; ulundo should not become “yulundo”.
Speakers of English must be especially mindful of their vowels when a
combination vowel + r occurs. In the combinations ar, or, many speakers
of English have a tendency to lengthen the vowel even where it should be
short (and many would also let the r drop out, especially when it is followed
by another consonant). But in Quenya words like narda (“knot”) or lorna
(“asleep”), the vowel before the r must be short, as indicated by the absence
of the accent mark. It is not permissible to let the pronunciation drift to-
wards “n´
a(r)da”, “l´
o(r)na”, no matter how tempting this is to people used
to English speech-habits.
Where the groups er, ir, ur occur (e.g. in words like serc¨
e “blood”,
tirno “watcher”, turma “shield”), speakers of English must take care NOT
to pronounce the vowels after the fashion of English serve, girl, turn. (I
once had an English teacher who described the vowel of “girl” as one of
the ugliest sounds of the English language. She taught English at university
level, so she should know – though perhaps she wasn’t wholly serious. . . )
Short e, i, u should sound just as described above, wholly irrespective of
the following r. In LotR Appendix E, Tolkien noted that er, ir, ur should
sound, not as in English fern, ﬁr, fur, but rather like air, eer, oor (that is,
like it would be natural for a speaker of English to pronounce orthographic
“air, eer, oor” – however, it should be understood that this would only be
an approximation of the ideal pronunciation). In the Peter Jackson movie,
the actors struggle to pronounce the ﬁnal syllable of the Quenya name Isil-
dur correctly, with variable results. In the ﬂash-back scene where Elrond
(played by Hugo Weaving) leads Isildur into Mount Doom and urges him
to destroy the Ring, Weaving’s pronunciation of the name Isildur is very
good – following Tolkien’s guidelines to the letter.
Diphthongs: In addition to the “basic”, unitary vowel-sounds discussed
above (what linguists would call the monophthongs), we have the diphthongs
– combinations of two basic vowels that are run together into one syllable, in
many ways behaving like a unitary vowel for the purpose of word-building:
The Quenya diphthongs are ai, au, eu, iu, oi, and ui.
• The diphthong ai is the same that is heard in English aisle. It is NOT
like the one in English mail, though English orthographic “ai” usually
represents the latter sound (can anyone think of other exceptions than
47


aisle?) The ﬁrst syllable of faila “just, generous” must not pronounced
like the English word fail, since Quenya ai always has the sound of
English I, eye: Aica “fell, terrible”, caima “bed”, aira “holy”. Of
course, the ﬁrst syllable of the latter word sounds nothing like English
air!
• The diphthong au is pronounced as in German Haus, or more or
less as the “ow” of English cow: aul¨
e “invention”, laur¨
ea “golden”,
taur¨
e “forest”. It is never sounded as in English caught, aura (in
which words “au” is pronounced rather like Quenya ´
o). In his “Note
on Pronunciation” appended to the Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien
notes that the ﬁrst syllable of Sauron should be like English sour,
not English sore. (However, the diphthong in sour is in British English
followed by a schwa – a faint reminiscence of the otherwise silent ﬁnal
r. This schwa should not be pronounced in Sauron.)
• The diphthong eu does not occur in English, but it is not dissimilar to
the “o” of English so. The only diﬀerence is that while the ﬁrst part
of the diphthong is a schwa in English, it should be a normal e (as in
end) in Quenya. In particular, some British upper-class pronunciations
of English “o” as in so come close to Quenya eu (but the American
pronunciation does not). Quenya examples: leuca “snake”, neuma
“snare”, peu “pair of lips”. This diphthong is not very common.
• The diphthong iu may be sounded like yu in English yule, according
to the usual Third Age Pronunciation. Tolkien imagined that origi-
nally, it had rather been a “falling” diphthong like the other Quenya
diphthongs, stressed on the ﬁrst rather than the last element (LotR
Appendix E). However, the Third Age pronunciation would be equally
“valid” also within the mythos, and for speakers of English it is easier
to achieve. This diphthong is in any case very rare; in the Etymologies
it is only attested in a handful of words (miul¨
e “whining, mewing”,
piuta “spit”, siul¨
e “incitement” and the group tiuca “thick, fat”,
tiuco “thigh” and tiuya- “swell, grow fat” – a few more examples of
iu could be quoted from Tolkien’s early “Qenya” material).
• The diphthong oi is easy, corresponding to English “oi” or “oy” as in
oil, toy: coir¨
ea “living”, soica “thirsty”, oira “eternal”.
• The diphthong ui Tolkien sometimes compared to the sound occurring
in English ruin. This is a rather surprising example, for surely the word
“ruin” is not normally pronounced as containing a diphthong, but as
two distinct syllables: ru-in. Rather think “ooy” as in the English
phrase too young: huin¨
e “shadow”, cuil¨
e “life”, uil¨
e “(long, trailing)
plant”. Notice that the combination qui does not contain this diph-
thong; this is just a more visually pleasing way of spelling cwi (e.g.
orqui “Orcs” = orcwi).
48


All other groups of vowels are not diphthongs, but simply vowels belonging
to separate syllables, to be pronounced distinctly. In linguistic terms, vowels
that are in direct contact without forming diphthongs are said to be in
hiatus. Primitive Elvish apparently did not have such combinations, at least
not in the middle of words: Tolkien had F¨
eanor concluding that “our fathers
. . . in building words took the vowels and parted them with the consonants
as walls” (VT39:10). But some consonants had been lost in Quenya, so
that vowels that were originally so “parted” had come into direct contact
(VT39:6). In Quenya we even have polysyllabic all-vowel words like E¨
a (a
name of the universe) or oa (“away”). The most frequent combinations of
vowels in hiatus are ea, eo, ie, io, oa; each vowel should be sounded “by
itself”. Tolkien often emphasizes this fact by adding diaereses or “dots”
to one of the vowels, and in the consistent spelling here imposed on the
material, we regularly write ¨
ea (E¨
a), ¨
eo (E¨
o), o¨
e. Thus there is no excuse
for such mistakes as pronouncing ¨
ea as in English heart or please, or o¨
e
as in canoe or foetus. (Other distortions are apparently also possible: Cate
Blanchett simply reduced E¨
arendil to “Erendil” the one time her version of
Galadriel pronounces this name in the Jackson movie: “I give you the light
of E[¨
a]rendil, our most beloved star. . . ” Can we have an extra vowel for the
Director’s Cut, please?)
In this course we do not use the diaeresis in the combinations ie (ex-
cept when ﬁnal) and oa, but as indicated by the spelling i¨
e and ¨
oa in
certain Tolkien manuscripts, the vowels must be pronounced distinctly and
not drawn together as in English piece (or tie), or English load. In accor-
dance with this, Christopher Tolkien in the Note on Pronunciation that he
appended to the Silmarillion indicates that the name Nienna is to be pro-
nounced Ni-enna, not “Neena” as if ie were sounded as in English piece.
(Immediately after the line in which she mangles the name E¨
arendil, Cate
Blanchett pronounces the Quenya word nam´
ari¨
e, “farewell”. I’m glad to
say that she did a better job with this word, getting the -i¨
e more or less
right!) Some words with vowels in hiatus: f¨
ea “soul”, l¨
eo “shade”, lo¨
end¨
e
“year-middle” (the middle day of the year according to the Elvish calendar),
coa “house”, ti¨
e “path”.
Consonants: Most Quenya consonants are easy to pronounce for people
used to speaking a Western language. These points may be observed:
• C is always pronounced k, never s; indeed Tolkien does use the letter k
rather than c in many sources. Celma “channel” or cirya “ship” must
not come out as “selma”, “sirya”. (This goes for Sindarin spelling as
well: When Celeborn is pronounced “Seleborn” in the Rankin/Bass
animated version of LotR, it clearly shows that the moviemakers never
made it to Appendix E.)
• In the groups hw, hy, hl, hr, the letter h is not to be pronounced
separately. These are just digraphs denoting unitary consonants:
49


• What is spelt hl, hr was originally unvoiced l, r. That is, these sounds
were pronounced without vibration in the vocal chords, resulting in
what may be described as “whispered” versions of normal l, r. (If you
can isolate the l of English please, you will have an unvoiced l – though
in this case, it is just “incidentally” unvoiced because of the inﬂuence
from the unvoiced plosive p immediately preceding it. English never
has unvoiced l as an independent sound of speech, as Quenya originally
did.) In Quenya, these sounds are quite rare; examples include hr´
ıv¨
e
“winter” and hl´
oc¨
e “serpent, dragon”. However, Tolkien stated that
by the Third Age, hr and hl had come to be pronounced as normal
voiced r, l, though the spelling hl, hr apparently persisted in writing.
• What is spelt hw corresponds to English wh in dialects where this
is still distinct from normal w (e.g., witch and which are audibly
distinct words – American English, as well as northern British En-
glish, normally uphold this distinction, though it has been abandoned
in the British Received Pronunciation). Put simply, hw is a (weak)
version of the sound you make when you blow out a candle. Hw
is not a very frequent sound in Quenya; this seems to be a quite
complete list of the known words where it occurs: hwan “sponge,
fungus”, hwarin “crooked”, hwarma “crossbar”, hwerm¨
e “gesture-
code”, hwesta “breeze, breath, puﬀof air” (also as verb: hwesta- “to
puﬀ”), hwind¨
e “eddy, whirlpool”.
• What is spelt hy represents a sound that may occur in English, but
that is not normally recognized as a distinct consonant in this lan-
guage. Hy denotes what by a German term is often referred to as
ich-Laut or “ich-sound”, since it is exempliﬁed by “ch” in the Ger-
man word ich (“I”). To speakers of English it may sound much like sh
(one imagines Kennedy training long and hard to avoid “Ish bin ein
Berliner”). Still, as I said, a (weak) version of the sound in question
may often be heard in English as well: In words like hew, huge, hu-
man, the h may be pronounced like an (obscure) hy. Cf. SD:418–419,
where Tolkien states that in Quenya or “Avallonian”, the sound hy
is “approximately equivalent to . . . h in huge”. In LotR Appendix E,
Tolkien also pointed out that hy has the same relationship to y as hw
(discussed above) has to normal w: one is unvoiced, the other voiced.
So another way of arriving at hy is to start with the sound of y (as
in you) and produce a voiceless, “whispered” variant of it. Once you
have the sound pinned down, you only have to strengthen it; it should
be pronounced with the same force as English sh: Hyarmen “south”,
hyalma “shell, conch”, hyell¨
e “glass”. It seems that hy mostly occurs
at the beginning of words; ahya- “change” is presently the sole known
example of hy occurring between vowels in the middle of a word. How-
ever, h in the combination ht following certain vowels should also be
50


pronounced like hy; see below. – In LotR Appendix E, Tolkien noted
that speakers of Westron (the supposed “original language” of the
Red Book, that Tolkien “translated” into English) often substituted
the sound of sh for Quenya hy. Speakers of English who don’t care
about subtle phonological details may of course do the same, turning a
word like hyalma into “shalma”. This would be a pronunciation that
existed also within the Middle-earth setting, though it was not quite
like the proper Elvish pronunciation (and it does seem best to aim for
the latter!) I guess many speakers of English would hardly be able to
tell the diﬀerence, though. Incidentally, one can achieve a pretty good
hy by starting from sh; just make sure that your tongue is not raised
(you may press its tip against the lower teeth to be certain of that). If
you try to pronounce sh with the tongue in this position, what comes
out ought to sound like hy.
• Outside the groups hw, hy, hl, hr, the letter h does represent an
independent sound, but it is pronounced somewhat diﬀerently in dif-
ferent positions. It seems that originally, Quenya h (at least where it
comes from Primitive Elvish kh) was typically stronger than English
h – that is, a “breath-h” as in high. In F¨
eanor’s day it was apparently
pronounced like ch in German ach or Scottish loch, or like Cyrillic X.
In phonetic writing, this sound is represented as [x]. But later, at the
beginning of words, this [x] was weakened and became a sound like
English h. In LotR Appendix E, Tolkien informs us that the Tengwa
letter for [x] was originally called harma; naturally this Tengwa was
so called because the initial h of this word was an example of the
sound the letter denoted, [x]. But when [x] in this position eventually
turned into an English-style h, the Tengwa was renamed aha, for in
the middle of words, [x] was not weakened. So we can extract these
rules: at the beginning of words (before a vowel), the letter h is to
be pronounced like English h. But in the middle of words, h is to be
pronounced [x]: as between vowels in aha “wrath”, and likewise before
t in words like pahta “closed”, ohta “war”, nuhta- “to stunt”.
In one late source, Tolkien noted that “in Quenya and Telerin medial
[x] eventually became h also in most cases” (VT41:9). It may therefore
be permissible to pronounce even words like aha with an English-style
breath-h. But the group ht must probably always be pronounced [xt];
the weaker breath-h would be barely audible in this position.
This rule needs one modiﬁcation. Likely, h before t was originally
pronounced [x] in all cases. Following any of the vowels a, o, and u,
this pronunciation persisted, as in the examples pahta, ohta, nuhta-
above. But following the vowels i and e, the original [x] turned into
a sound similar to German ich-Laut (German may indeed be Tolkien’s
inspiration for this particular development in Quenya phonology).
51


Thus in words like eht¨
e “spear” or rihta- “to jerk”, h should be
pronounced just like the hy described above. Again, Tolkien imagined
that human (mortal) speakers of Westron had a tendency to substitute
a sound like English sh and say “esht¨
e”, “rishta” instead.
• Quenya l “represents more or less the sound of English initial l, as in
let” (LotR Appendix E). Now why did Tolkien specify that Quenya l is
to sound like an initial English l (regardless of its position in a Quenya
word)? As Tolkien was well aware, British English l is pronounced
somewhat diﬀerently in diﬀerent positions. An initial l, as in let, is
pronounced as a so-called “clear” l – and this is the kind of l that
should be used in all positions in Quenya (as is also the case in other
languages, like German). But when l is not initial, English in most
cases employs a so-called “dark” l, which diﬀers from the the “clear”
l in that the “dark” variant is pronounced by arching the back of the
tongue upwards: Contrast the pronunciation of l in two words like let
(clear l) and ﬁll (dark l). Compared to the “clear” l, the “dark” l
sounds lower pitched, but this sound is to be avoided in Quenya. This
may be something of a problem to Americans, since their L’s tend to
be rather “dark” in all positions, even initially (at least as perceived
by European ears). – Perfectionists should also observe another detail:
In Letters:425, Tolkien mentioned l among the Quenya “dentals”, sc.
sounds that are pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching the
(upper) teeth. English normally uses an alveolar l instead, that is, a
sound pronounced with the tip of the tongue further back, above the
teeth rather than touching them. This again makes for a somewhat
“darker” sound. When pronouncing a Quenya l, one should make sure
that that the tip of the tongue touches the teeth.
• Quenya n is like English n. Usually this sound had been n all along,
but in some cases it represents older ng as in English king, ding (notice
that there is no distinct g to be heard, despite the spelling). Unlike En-
glish, Quenya could also have this sound at the beginning of words. As
mentioned in the discussion of spelling conventions, Tolkien sometimes
used the letter ˜
n to represent this older ng, e.g. ˜
Noldor. In his letters,
Tolkien in one case added a footnote to the word Noldor (so spelt),
informing the recipient that the initial N was to be pronounced “ng
as in ding” (Letters:176). This would however be the “archaic” pro-
nunciation; people speaking Quenya in Frodo’s day would simply say
Noldor: LotR Appendix E clearly indicates that by the Third Age,
initial ˜
n had come to be pronounced like a normal n, and therefore
the Elvish letter for ˜
n “has been transcribed n”. We have adopted the
same system here, so the letter n in nearly all cases represents normal
English n, regardless of its phonological history in Quenya. I say “in
nearly all cases” because n is still pronounced ˜
n before c (= k), g and
52


qu. This is not much of a problem, for it is natural for speakers of
English and many other languages to use this pronunciation anyway.
In a word like anca “jaw” the cluster nc is therefore pronounced like
“nk” in English tank, and in a word like anga “iron” the ng should be
sounded like “ng” in English ﬁnger. Notice that Quenya ng occurring
in the middle of words should always be pronounced with an audible g
(this also goes for the group ngw, as in tengwa “letter”). It is NOT
just the simple ˜
n described above, the “ng” of English king, with no
distinct g. (We are of course talking about a hard g here; Quenya ng
must never be pronounced “nj” as in English angel, but always as
in ﬁnger. The sound of “soft” g as in English gin does not occur in
Quenya.)
• Quenya r “represents a trilled r in all positions; the sound was not
lost before consonants (as in [British] English part)” (LotR Appendix
E). English r is generally much too weak for Quenya. Its weakness is
precisely the reason why it tends to drop out before consonants and
at the end of words (except where the next word happens to begin
in a vowel – and by analogy, some speakers of English even introduce
an R-sound where a word that properly should end in a vowel comes
before a word beginning in a vowel. That is when vanilla ice starts
coming out as “vanillar ice” – or, if you like, “vanilla rice”! Of course,
this must be avoided in Quenya.) Quenya r should be trilled, as in
Spanish, Italian, Russian etc., or for that matter as in Scottish English.
Certain subtleties of Tengwar spelling suggests that in Quenya, r was
somewhat weaker immediately in front of consonants (as opposed to
vowels) and at the end of words. Nonetheless, it should be a properly
trilled, wholly distinct sound even in these positions: Parma “book”,
erd¨
e “seed”, tasar “willow”, Eldar “Elves”. The vowel in front of r
should not be lengthened or otherwise aﬀected. In the Jackson movie,
the actors portraying Gandalf and Saruman normally pronounce the
name Mordor correctly, with trilled r’s and short vowels (whereas
Elijah Wood’s “Frodo” invariably says M´
od´
o with no trace of any r’s!)
In the movie, – Mordor is Sindarin for Black Land, but by its form
and pronunciation, the word could just as well be Quenya mordor =
“shadows” or “stains” (the plural form of mordo).
The uvular r that is common in languages like French and German
should be avoided in Quenya, for LotR Appendix E states that this
was “a sound which the Eldar found distasteful” (it is even suggested
that this was how the Orcs pronounced R!)
• The consonant s should always be unvoiced, “as in English so, geese”
(LotR Appendix E). In English, s is often voiced to z, even though
orthography may still show “s”. For instance, though the s of English
house is unvoiced, it becomes voiced in the plural form houses (for
53


this reason, Tolkien noted that he would have liked the spelling houzes
better – see PM:24). When pronouncing Quenya, one should be careful
not to add voice to s, turning it into z: Asar “festival”, olos “dream”,
naus¨
e “imagination”. Third Age Exilic Quenya did not possess the
sound z at all. (Tolkien did imagine that z had occurred at an earlier
stage, but it had later turned into r, merging with original r. For
instance, UT:396 indicates that the plural of olos “dream” was at
one stage olozi, but later it became olori.) Where it occurs between
vowels, s often represents earlier þ (more or less = th as in thin);
the words asar and naus¨
e mentioned above represent older aþar and
nauþ¨
e and were so spelt in Tengwar orthography.
• On v and w: We must assume that v and w are properly pronounced
as in English vine and wine, respectively (but initial nw is strictly
not n + w but simply a so-called labialized n; see below). There are
some unclear points here, though. LotR Appendix E seems to indicate
that in Third Age Quenya, initial w had come to be pronounced v: it is
said that the name of the Tengwa letter vilya had earlier been wilya.
Likewise, Tolkien indicated that the word v´
era (“personal, private,
own”) had been w´
era in what he called “Old Quenya” (PM:340).
In the Etymologies, the evidence is somewhat divergent. Sometimes
Tolkien has primitive stems in w- yield Quenya words in v-, as when
the stem wan yields Quenya vanya- “go, depart, disappear”. Some-
times he lists double forms, as when the stem wˆ
a (or wawa, waiwa)
yields Quenya vaiwa and waiwa, both meaning “wind”. Under the
stem way Tolkien listed a word for “envelope” as “w- vaia”, evidently
indicating a double form waia and vaia (all of these examples are
found in LR:397). In LR:398, there are further double forms, but in
the case of the verb vilin (“I ﬂy”) from the stem wil, Tolkien curi-
ously changed it to wilin. Perhaps he suddenly decided to go for the
“Old Quenya” spelling rather than actually rejecting one in favour of
the other?
The weight of the evidence seems to be that at the beginning of words,
w- had come to be pronounced as normal v- by the Third Age; where
Tolkien listed double forms in w- and v-, the former is apparently to
be taken as the more archaic form. However, I have not regularized
the spelling on this point, though where Tolkien himself used or listed
a form in v- rather than w- (either alone or as an alternative to w-),
I will use the form in v- in this course. (This also goes for vilin!) It
is possible, though, that according to the Third Age pronunciation all
initial w’s should be sounded as v, the original distinction between
initial v and w having been lost in the spoken language. It is unclear
whether or not Tolkien meant that this distinction was consistently
upheld in Tengwar orthography (as when this writing upheld the dis-
54


tinction between þ and s even after both had come to be pronounced
s). If so, the letter called (wilya >) vilya was still used for v repre-
senting older w, while another letter (vala) was used for v that had
been v all along. – Other than at the beginning of words, the dis-
tinction between v and w was upheld even in the Third Age. In the
case of the groups lw and lv the distinction could even be empha-
sized by altering the pronunciation of the latter: “For lv, not for lw,
many speakers, especially Elves, used lb” (LotR Appendix E). Hence
a word like elv¨
ea “starlike” would often be pronounced “elb¨
ea”, and
it might also be so written in Tengwar orthography. Though frequent,
this would seem to be a non-standard pronunciation, and the spellings
employed by Tolkien usually indicates the pronunciation “lv”. Cf. for
instance Celvar (or “Kelvar”, meaning animals) rather than Celbar
in the speeches of Yavanna and Manw¨
e in the Silmarillion, chapter 2.
In PM:340 Tolkien quotes a Quenya word for “branch” as olba rather
than olva, though.
• The letter y “is only used as a consonant, as y in E[nglish] Yes”:
Tolkien singled this out as one of the few major departures from Latin
spelling in the spelling conventions he used for Quenya (Letters:176).
The vowel y, like German ¨
u or French “u” as in lune, does not occur
in Quenya (though it is found in Sindarin).
The question of aspiration
There is one uncertainty regarding the precise pronunciation the unvoiced
stops c (= k), t, p: In English as well as some other languages, these sounds,
when occurring before a vowel at the beginning of a word, are normally
aspirated. That is, a h-like puﬀof breath is slipped in after them. In this
position they are pronounced a little like genuine sequences k + h, t +
h, p + h (as in backhand, outhouse, scrap-heap). The average speaker is
not conscious of this at all, not really perceiving the extra h as a distinct
sound: It is just the way k, t, p is “expected” to sound at the beginning
of words. But in some languages, like French, Russian and (perhaps most
importantly) Finnish, there is no such gratuitous h automatically following
these consonants when they occur in certain positions.
Should Quenya t, p, c be aspirated as in English, or should they be pro-
nounced as in French or Finnish? This question is not directly addressed
anywhere in Tolkien’s published writings. It may be observed that Quenya
t, p, c descend from Primitive Elvish consonants that were certainly not
aspirated, for in the primitive language they contrasted with distinct aspi-
rated sounds: primitive th, ph, kh, which later became s, f, h in Quenya.
(Cf. two wholly distinct primitive words like thaurˆ
a “detestable” and taurˆ
a
“masterful” – the th of the ﬁrst word should be sounded the way a speaker of
English would most likely mispronounce the t of the latter! The t of taurˆ
a
55


should actually be pronounced French-style, with no aspiration.) So were
Quenya t, p, c still unaspirated, since they had been so in the primitive
language?
Since the primitive aspirated sounds had been changed, adding aspiration
to t, p, c would cause no confusion. It should be noted, though, that in
the writing system devised by F¨
eanor, there were originally distinct letters
for aspirated sounds: “The original F¨
eanorian system also possessed a grade
with extended stems, both above and below the line [of writing]. These
usually represented aspirated consonants (e.g. t + h, p + h, k + h)” (LotR
Appendix E). However, these were not the letters used to spell Quenya t,
p, c. So all things considered, I think Quenya t, p, c should ideally be
pronounced without aspiration. For people who are used to automatically
slip in a h-like puﬀof breath after these consonants it may be diﬃcult to get
rid of it, since they are not really conscious of its presence at all. A phonology
teacher once advised me that one way of getting rid of the aspiration is to
practice pronouncing t, p, c/k with a burning candle in front of your mouth;
the trick is to pronounce these consonants without the ﬂame of the candle
ﬂickering (because of the puﬀof breath that constitutes the aspiration).
The voiced counterparts of t, p and c/k, namely d, b and (hard) g re-
spectively, are not aspirated in English. For this reason, people who are
used to hearing the unvoiced sounds pronounced as aspirated variants may
(wrongly) perceive unaspirated unvoiced plosives as their voiced counter-
parts. Pronounced without aspiration, Quenya words like tarya (“stiﬀ”),
parma (“book”) or calma (“lamp”) may sound a little like “darya, barma,
galma” to speakers of English (speakers of French, Russian or Finnish would
not be confused). When pronouncing such words, one must not introduce
vibration in the vocal chords to produce actual voiced sounds d, b, g. –
But I should add that the whole aspiration issue is not something a student
needs to spend much time on; as I said, the exact pronunciation of Quenya
t, p, c is nowhere addressed in published writings. If it is indeed wrong to
add aspiration to these consonants, at least one will err little more than
Tolkien did himself when reading Nam´
ari¨
e.
Palatalized and labialized consonants
In Quenya, we ﬁnd words like nyarna “tale”, tyali¨
e “play” or nwalca
“cruel”. From these spellings it would seem that such words begin in conso-
nant clusters: n + y, t + y, n + w. However, this would not agree with the
explicit statement made in Lowdham’s Report that “Adunaic, like Aval-
lonian [= Quenya], does not tolerate more than a single basic consonant
initially in any word” (SD:417–418). So how are we to explain this?
The solution seems to be that “combinations” like the ny of nyarna are
just single, basic consonants: Ny is not a cluster n + y, but the same unitary
sound that is ﬁttingly represented as a single letter “˜
n” in Spanish orthogra-
56


phy – as in se˜
nor. Of course, this sounds very much like “senyor”, but “˜
n” is
really a single consonant. This “˜
n” is a palatalized version of n, an n that has
been “tinted” in the direction of y. English employs one distinctly palatal-
ized consonant, usually represented by the digraph “sh” (which, of course,
is not a cluster s + h); this can be described as a palatalized s. By carefully
comparing the pronunciation of s and sh you can perceive the palataliza-
tion mechanism operating in your own mouth: A consonant is palatalized by
arching the back of the tongue up towards the roof of the mouth (the palate,
hence the term “palatalized consonant”). The relationship between s and
sh corresponds to the relationship between n and Quenya ny (or Spanish
“˜
n”).
Besides ny, Quenya also has the palatalized consonants ty, ly, ry (e.g. in
tyali¨
e “play”, alya “rich”, verya “bold”); these are palatalized counterparts
of “normal” t, l, r. Regarding ty, Tolkien wrote that it may be pronounced
as the “t” of English tune (see for instance SD:418–419 – it should be noted
that he is thinking of dialects where this comes out as “tyoon”; this is not
the case in all forms of American English). In Gondor, some mortal speakers
of Quenya supposedly pronounced ty like ch as in English church, but
that was not quite the proper Elvish pronunciation. As for the consonant
ly, it would be similar to the “lh” of Portuguese olho (“eye”). In LotR
Appendix E, Tolkien noted that l (so spelt) should also “to some degree
[be] ‘palatalized’ between e, i and a consonant, or ﬁnally after e, i”. The
wording “to some degree” seems to suggest that we would not have a regular,
“full-blown” palatalized l in these positions (like the sound spelt ly), but in
words like Eldar “Elves” or amil “mother”, the l should ideally have just
a little tint of palatalizing to it.
Besides the palatalized consonants, we have the labialized consonants: nw,
gw and qu (= cw). These are not really clusters n + w, g + w, c + w.
Rather they represent n, g, c (k) pronounced with pouted lips, as when
pronouncing w: By the pouting of the lips, the consonant is “labialized”
(this word comes from the Latin term for “lip”). Quenya qu may certainly
be pronounced as in English queen, but ideally it should be pronounced as k
and w merged together in a single, unitary sound. (True, there does exist one
early source where Tolkien states that qu, though originally being simply
k “accomp[anied] by lip-rounding”, “is now sounded practically exactly as
English qu – a liprounded k foll[owed] by a distinct w sound”: See Parma
Eldalamberon #13, page 63. However, I think this idea may be superseded by
information from a much later source, indicating that Quenya had no initial
consonant clusters: SD:417–418.) Nw and gw similarly represent “merged”
versions of n/w, g/w. – It should be noted that nw is a single, labialized
consonant only at the beginning of words, where it represents earlier ngw
(sc. what Tolkien might also spell “˜
nw”, using “˜
n” for ng as in king). In the
middle of words, e.g. in vanwa “gone, lost”, nw really is a cluster n + w and
is so spelt also in Tengwar orthography. However, the labialized consonants
57


qu and gw also occur in the middle of words. In fact, gw occurs only in
that position, and always in the combination ngw (not “˜
nw” but “˜
ngw”,
still using “˜
n” as Tolkien did): Lingw¨
e “ﬁsh”, nangwa “jaw”, sungwa
“drinking-vessel”.
The question of length: It may seem that when they occur medially be-
tween vowels, the palatalized and labialized consonants count as long or
double consonants (as if the digraphs represented actual consonant clusters
after all). Again using the letter “˜
n” with its Spanish value of a palatalized
n (and not, as Tolkien often did, for ng as in king), one may ask whether a
word like atarinya (“my father”, LR:61) actually represents “atari˜
n˜
na”. If
so, the group ny in the middle of words denotes a long palatalized N. Then
the very word Quenya would be pronounced “Que˜
n˜
na” rather than “Quen-
ya”. Another possibility is “Que˜
nya”, the n being palatalized all right, but
there is still a relatively distinct y-sound following it (which there would
not be when ny occurs at the beginning of a word). Tolkien reading a ver-
sion of Nam´
ari¨
e at least once pronounced the word inyar as “i˜
n˜
nar” (but
the second time it occurred he simply said “inyar” with n + y). In any
case, the groups ny, ly, ry, ty and qu (for cw) must be counted as either
long consonants or consonant clusters for the purpose of stress (see below)
– though it is also clear that sometimes they must be analyzed as single,
unitary consonants.
Stress
Whenever a language has polysyllabic words, speakers of this language may
enunciate some syllables more forcefully than others. We say that these
syllables are stressed or accented. In some languages speakers don’t normally
emphasize certain syllables more than others. For instance, the Japanese
put about the same amount of stress on every syllable, resulting in what
unloving foreigners have referred to as “machine gun articulation”. But in
Western languages, a varying amount of stress is common: Some syllables
are stressed, others unstressed.
The rules for which syllables are stressed vary wildly, though. Some lan-
guages have a very simple system; in French, words that are to receive any
stress are always accented on the ﬁnal syllable. To the natives, Paris is not
“PARis” as in English, but rather “parIS” (actually the French don’t pro-
nounce the s, but that has nothing to do with the accent). The Finns also
have a very simple system, stressing all words on the ﬁrst syllable: While
some speakers of English may think that Helsinki is most “naturally” pro-
nounced “HelSINKi”, the residents of the city will insist on “HELsinki”
instead.
Since the Finnish language was evidently Tolkien’s foremost inspiration,
one might think that he would have copied its simple system of accenting
all words on the ﬁrst syllable over into Quenya. In the “internal” or ﬁctional
58


history of the language, he did indeed envision an early period during which
Quenya words were so accented (the so-called retraction period, WJ:366).
However, this was replaced by a new system already before the Noldor went
into exile, so Quenya as a language of lore in Middle-earth employed diﬀerent
accentuation patterns, carefully described in LotR Appendix E. This is the
system we must use. (It seems that Tolkien actually copied it from Latin!)
Words of one syllable, like nat “thing”, obviously pose no problem; this
one syllable is the sole candidate for receiving the stress. The simplest poly-
syllabic words, those of two syllables, are no problem either: In LotR Ap-
pendix E, Tolkien noted that “in words of two syllables [the accent] falls
in practically all cases on the ﬁrst syllable”. As this wording implies, there
may be a very few exceptions; the only exception known seems to be the
word av´
a “don’t!”, that is accented on the ﬁnal syllable: “aV ´
A”. (Even
this one word also appears in the alternative form ´
ava, stressed on the ﬁrst
syllable according to the normal rule: “ ´
AV a”.) The name of the Blessed
Realm, Aman, I sometimes hear people pronounce with the stress on the
second rather than the ﬁrst syllable – but the correct pronunciation must
be “AM an”, if we can trust the rules set out by Tolkien. (“AmAN ” would
be Amman, capital of Jordan!)
Longer words, with three or more syllables, are slightly more complex
when it comes to stress. Many of them are accented on the second to last
syllable. However, in some cases the second-to-last syllable isn’t “qualiﬁed”
to receive the accent: This syllable cannot be accented if it is short. So how
do we recognize a short syllable? If it contains no long vowel (no vowel
marked with an accent), this is obviously one omen. Then the vowel itself
is necessarily short. If this short vowel is followed by only one consonant,
or even no consonant at all, this syllable has little chance of receiving the
accent. Its one remaining chance of redeeming itself as a long syllable is
that instead of a simple short vowel it actually contains one of the Quenya
diphthongs: ai, au, eu, oi, ui or iu. Two vowels combined into a diphthong
count as having the same “length” as a normal, unitary long vowel (marked
by an accent). But if there is no diphthong, no long vowel, and not even a
short vowel followed by more than one consonant, the syllable in question is
irredeemably short. If this is the second-to-last syllable in a word of three or
more syllables, this penultimate syllable has forfeited all its chances to re-
ceive the stress. In such a case the stress moves one step ahead, to fall on the
third syllable from the end (no matter what this syllable looks like). Tolkien
noted that words of such a shape “are favoured in the Eldarin languages,
especially Quenya”. Examples:
• A word like vestal¨
e “wedding” is accented “VESTal¨
e”. The second-
to-last syllable cannot receive the stress because its vowel (the a) is
short and followed by only a single consonant (the l); hence the accent
moves one step ahead, to the third syllable from the end. Plural forms
59


like Teleri (the Sea-Elves) and Istari (the Wizards) I sometimes hear
people mispronounce as “TeLERi”, “IsTARi”; applying Tolkien’s rules
we have to conclude that he actually intended “TELeri”, “ISTari”.
The short penultimate syllables in these words cannot be accented.
• A word like Eress¨
ea (the name of an isle near the Blessed Realm) some
speakers of English are tempted to accent on the second-to-last syl-
lable (following the stress-pattern of such a place-name as “Eritrea”!)
But since in Er-ess-¨
e-a the second-to-last syllable is just a short ¨
e
not followed by a group of consonants (actually not even one conso-
nant), this syllable cannot be accented and the stress moves to the
syllable before it: “ErESS¨
ea”. Other words of the same pattern (with
no consonant following a short vowel in the second-to-last syllable):
Eldali¨
e “the people of the Elves” (“ElDAli¨
e” – though the word Elda
“Elf” by itself is of course accented “ELda”), Tilion “The Horned”,
name of a Maia (“TILion”), laur¨
ea “golden” (“LAUR¨
ea”), Yavanni¨
e
“September” (“YaVANN i¨
e”), Silmarillion “[The Story] of the Sil-
marils” (“SilmaRILLion”).
But though such words were “favoured”, there is certainly no lack of
words where the second-to-last syllable does qualify for receiving the
accent. Examples:
• Varda’s title Elent´
ari “Star-Queen” is pronounced “ElenT ´
ARi”, since
the vowel ´
a in the second-to-last syllable is long. (If this had been a
short a, it couldn’t have been stressed since it is not followed by more
than one consonant, and the third syllable from the end would have
been accented instead: “ELEN tari” – but no such word exists.) The
names N´
umen´
or¨
e, Valin´
or¨
e are likewise accented on the long ´
o in
the second-to-last syllable (whereas in the shortened forms N´
umenor,
Valinor the accent must fall on the third syllable from the end:
N ´
UMenor, VALinor).
• Words like hastaina “marred” or Valarauco “Power-demon” (Sin-
darin Balrog) are accented “hasTAIN a”, “ValaRAUCo” – since diph-
thongs like ai, au can be counted as long vowels for the purpose of
stress.
• The names Elendil and Isildur are accented “ElENDil” and “IsILD-
ur”, since the vowel in the second-to-last-syllable, though short, is
followed by more than one consonant (the groups nd, ld, respectively).
A double consonant would have the same eﬀect as a cluster of diﬀerent
consonants; for instance, Elenna (“Starwards”, a name of N´
umenor) is
pronounced “ElENN a”. (Contrast the adjective elena “stellar, of the
stars”: this must be accented “ELena” since the second-to-last syllable
“en” is short and therefore unable to receive the accent – unlike the
long syllable “enn” in Elenna.)
60


Notice that the one letter x represents two consonants, ks. Therefore, a
word like Helcarax¨
e (a place-name) is accented “HelcarAX¨
e” (not “Hel-
CARax¨
e” as if there were only one consonant following the a in the second-
to-last syllable). Cf. the alternative spelling Helkarakse in the Etymologies,
entry karak.
As noted above, some combinations should apparently be thought of as
single consonants: qu (for cw/kw) represents labialized k, not k + w. Sim-
ilarly, ny, ty, ly, ry would be palatalized n, t, l, r (the ﬁrst = Spanish ˜
n).
But in the middle of words, for the purpose of stress, it seems that qu, ly,
ny, ty etc. do count as groups of consonants (double consonants or clusters
– we cannot be certain precisely what Tolkien intended). In WJ:407, Tolkien
indicates that the compound word ciryaquen “shipman, sailor” (made from
cirya “ship” + -quen “person”) is to be accented “cirYAquen”. If qu (=
cw/kw) were here thought of as a single consonant, labialized k, there would
not be a group of consonants following the a and it could not receive the ac-
cent: the word would then have been pronounced “CIRyaquen” instead. So
either qu here does count as a cluster k + w, or it represents a long or double
labialized k (or even labialized kw followed by w). Bottom line is: pronounce
“cirYAquen” and be relieved that the rest is mainly academic meandering.
A few other words including the combinations in question: Elenya (ﬁrst day
of the Eldarin six-day week, accented “ElEN ya”), Calacirya or Calacilya
(a place in the Blessed Realm, accented “CalaCI rya”, “CalaCI lya”).
A word of warning regarding the accent mark: Notice that the accent mark
that may appear above vowels (´
a, ´
e, ´
ı, ´
o, ´
u) only denotes that the vowel is
long. While this symbol is frequently used to indicate the stressed syllable,
this is not the case in Tolkien’s normal spelling of Quenya. (Some may have
noted that Pok´
emon isn’t accented on the ´
e either, so Tolkien isn’t wildly
idiosyncratic in this department!) A long vowel will often receive the stress,
as in the example Elent´
ari above, but not necessarily so: If the long vowel
does not appear in the second-to-last syllable, its length (and the accent
mark denoting it!) is quite irrelevant for the purpose of stress. In a word
like ´
Ulairi, the Quenya name for the Ringwraiths or Nazgˆ
ul, the stress
falls on the diphthong ai, not on the ´
u. The spelling palant´
ır has mislead
many, making them think that this word is to be accented on “t´
ır”. Here is
something Ian McKellen, playing Gandalf in the Peter Jackson LotR movie
trilogy, wrote as the ﬁlm was being shot:
. . . I have to learn a new pronunciation. All this time we have
being saying “palanT´
IR” instead of the Old English stress on
the ﬁrst syllable. Just as the word was about to be commit-
ted to the soundtrack, a correction came from Andrew Jack,
the Dialect Coach; he taught me a Norfolk accent for Restora-
tion, and for LOTR he supervises accents, languages and all
things vocal. Palant´
ır, being strictly of elvish origin should fol-
61


low Tolkien’s rule that the syllable before a double consonant
should be stressed – “paLANT´
ır” making a sound which is close
to “lantern”. . .
Andrew Jack was right. Palant´
ır cannot be stressed on the ﬁnal syllable;
virtually no polysyllabic Quenya words are accented in such a way (as I said
above, av´
a “don’t!” is the sole known exception). Instead the a in the second-
to-last syllable receives the accent because it is followed by the consonant
cluster nt (I should not call this a “double consonant” like McKellen does,
since I want to reserve that term for a group of two identical consonants,
like tt or nn – but for the purpose of stress, double consonants and clusters
of diﬀerent consonants have the same eﬀect). So it is indeed “palANT´
ır”.
(But in the plural form palant´
ıri, where the long ´
ı suddenly appears in the
second-to-last syllable, it does receive the accent: “palanT´
IRi”.)
In the case of long words ending in two short syllables, the last of these syl-
lables may receive a weaker secondary stress. In a word like h´
ısim¨
e “mist”,
the main stress falls on h´
ıs, but the ﬁnal syllable -m¨
e is not wholly un-
stressed. This secondary stress is much weaker than the main accent, though.
(Nonetheless, Tolkien did note that for the purpose of poetry, the secondary
stress can be used metrically: RGEO:69.)
Speed
Finally a brief note on something we know little about: How fast should
one talk when speaking Quenya? The few recordings of Tolkien speaking
Quenya are not “reliable” in this matter; he inevitably enunciates quite
carefully. But regarding F¨
eanor’s mother M´
ıriel he noted that “she spoke
swiftly and took pride in this skill” (PM:333). So fast Quenya is evidently
good Quenya. When Tolkien also wrote that “the Elves made considerable
use of . . . concomitant gestures” (WJ:416), one remembers that he had a
great love for Italian – see Letters:223.
Summary of Lesson One
The Quenya vowels are a, e, i, o, u; long vowels are marked with an accent:
´
a, ´
e etc. The vowels should be pure, pronounced with their “Italian” values;
long ´
a and ´
e should be noticably closer than short a, e. Some vowels may
receive a diaeresis (¨
e, ¨
a etc.), but this does not aﬀect their pronunciation and
is only intended as a clariﬁcation for people used to English orthography.
The diphthongs are ai, au, eu, oi, ui, and iu. The consonant c is always
pronounced k; l should be pronounced as a “clear”, dental L; r should be
trilled; s is always unvoiced; y is only used as a consonant (as in English
you). Ideally, the consonants t, p, c should probably be unaspirated. Palatal-
ized consonants are represented by digraphs in -y (ty, ny etc.); labialized
62


consonants are normally written as digraphs in -w (e.g. nw, but what would
be cw is spelt qu instead). H is pronounced [x] (German ach-Laut) before t,
unless this combination ht is preceded by one of the vowels e or i, in which
case h is sounded like German ich-Laut. Otherwise, h may be pronounced
like English h; the digraphs hy and hw however represent ich-Laut and un-
voiced w (like American English wh), respectively. The combinations hl and
hr originally represented unvoiced l, r, but by the Third Age, these sounds
had come to be pronounced like normal l and r. In polysyllabic words, the
stress falls on the second-to-last syllable when that is long (containing either
a long vowel, a diphthong, or a vowel followed by a consonant cluster or a
double consonant). If the second-to-last syllable is short, the stress falls on
the third syllable from the end (unless the word has only two syllables, in
which case the ﬁrst syllable receives the stress whether it is short or long).
Exercises
As far as the most critical subtleties of pronunciation are concerned, I un-
fortunately cannot make any exercises; we are not in a classroom so that I
can comment on your pronunciation. But regarding stress (accent) and the
pronunciation of h, it is possible to make exercises.
1. Determine which vowel (single vowel or diphthong) receives the accent
in the words below. (It is not necessary to indicate where the entire
syllable it belongs to begins and ends.)
A. Alcar (“glory”)
B. Alcar¨
e (longer variant of the above)
C. Alcarinqua (“glorious”)
D. Calima (“bright”)
E. Oronti (“mountains”)
F. ´
Un´
otim¨
e (“uncountable, numberless”)
G. Envinyatar (“renewer”)
H. Ulund¨
e (“ﬂood”)
I. E¨
aruil¨
e (“seaweed”)
J. Ercass¨
e (“holly”)
Extra exercise on stress: While we hear many Sindarin lines in the
movie, one of the few really prominent samples of Quenya in Peter
Jackson’s The Fellowship of the Ring is the scene where “Saruman”
(Christopher Lee) standing on the top of Isengard reads an invocation
to bring down an avalanche in order to stop the Fellowship. He says to
the mountain they are attempting to cross: Nai yarvax¨
ea rasselya
63


taltuva notto-carinnar! = “may your bloodstained horn collapse
upon enemy heads!” (not translated in the movie). The actor accents
the words like this: nai yarVAX¨
ea RASSelya TALTuva notto-
CARinnar. Are all the words accented as they should be, according
to Tolkien’s guidelines? If not, what is right and what is wrong?
2. Where the letter h appears in Quenya words as they are spelt in our
letters, it may be pronounced in various ways. Ignoring the digraphs
hw and hy, the letter h may be pronounced
A) a “breath-h” like English h as in high,
B) more or less as in English huge, human or ideally like ch in
German ich,
C) like ch in German ach or Scottish loch (in phonetic writing [x]).
In addition we have alternative D): the letter h is not really pronounced
at all, but merely indicates that the following consonant was unvoiced
in archaic Quenya.
Sort the words below into these four categories (A, B, C, D):
K. Ohtar (“warrior”)
L. Hr´
av¨
e (“ﬂesh”)
M. Nahta (“a bite”)
N. Heru (“lord”)
O. Neht¨
e (“spearhead”)
P. Mahalma (“throne”)
Q. Hell¨
e (“sky”)
R. Tihtala (“blinking”)
S. Hl´
oc¨
e (“snake, serpent”)
T. H´

Lesson 2
Nouns. Plural form. The article.
2.1
The Noun
Words that denote things, as opposed to for instance actions, are called
nouns. The “things” in question may be inanimate (like “stone”), animate
(like “person”, “woman”, “boy”), natural (like “tree”), artiﬁcial (like
“bridge, house”), concrete (like “stone” again) or wholly abstract (like “ha-
tred”). Names of persons, like “Peter” or “Mary”, are also considered nouns.
Sometimes a noun may denote, not one clearly distinct object or person, but
an entire substance (like “gold” or “water”). So there is much to be included.
In most languages, a noun can be inﬂected, that is, it appears in various
forms to modify its meaning, or to make it ﬁt into a speciﬁc grammatical
context. For instance, if you want to connect two English nouns like “Mary”
and “house” in such a way as to make it clear that Mary owns the house,
you modify the form of the noun Mary by adding the ending -’s, producing
Mary’s, which readily connects with house to make the phrase Mary’s house.
Or starting with a noun like tree, you may want to make it clear that you
are talking about more than one singular tree, and so you modify the word
to its plural form by adding the plural ending -s to get trees. In English, a
noun doesn’t have very many forms at all; there is the singular (e.g. girl),
its plural (girls), the form you use when the one denoted by the noun owns
something (girl’s) and the combination of the plural and this “ownership”-
form (written girls’ and unfortunately not really distinct from girls or girl’s
in sound, but speakers of English somehow get along without too many
misunderstandings – rest assured that the Quenya equivalents are clearly
distinct in form!) So an English noun comes in no more than four diﬀerent
forms.
A Quenya noun, on the other hand, comes in hundreds of diﬀerent forms.
It can receive endings not only for two diﬀerent kinds of plural, plus endings
denoting a pair of things, but also endings expressing meanings that in
English would be denoted by placing small words like “for, in/on, from,
to, of, with” etc. in front of the noun instead. Finally a Quenya noun can
65


also receive endings denoting who owns it, e.g. -rya- “her” in m´
aryat “her
hands” in Nam´
ari¨
e (the ﬁnal -t, by the way, is one of the endings denoting
a pair of something – in this case a natural pair of hands).
Having read the above, the student should not succumb to the idea that
Quenya is a horribly diﬃcult language (“imagine, hundreds of diﬀerent forms
to learn where English has only four!”), or for that matter start thinking
that Quenya must be some kind of super-language (“wow, hundreds of dif-
ferent forms to play with while the poor English-speaking sods have to get
along with a pitiful four!”) English and Quenya organize the information
diﬀerently, that is all – the former often preferring a string of short words,
the latter rather jumbling the ideas to be expressed into one big mouth-
ful. The hundreds of diﬀerent forms arise because a much lower number of
endings can be combined, so there is no reason to despair. It is a little like
counting; you needn’t learn two hundred and ﬁfty diﬀerent numeric symbols
to be able to count to 250, but only the ten from 0 to 9.
Most of the endings a noun can take we won’t discuss before in (much)
later lessons. We will start with something that should be familiar enough,
found even on the puny list of English noun-forms: Making a noun plural –
going from one to several.
In Quenya, there are two diﬀerent plurals. One is formed by adding the
ending -li to the noun. Tolkien called this the “partitive plural” (WJ:388) or
a “general pl[ural]” (see the Etymologies, entry teles). Unfortunately, the
function of this plural – sc. how it diﬀers in meaning from the more “normal”
plural discussed below – is not fully understood. We have a few examples of
this plural in our scarce source material, but they are not very helpful. For
a long time it was assumed that this plural implied that there were “many”
of the things in question; hence Eldali (formed from Elda “Elf”) would
mean something like “many Elves”. There may be something to this, but in
several of the examples we have, there seems to be no implication of “many”.
It has been suggested that Eldali may rather mean something like “several
Elves” or “some Elves”, sc. some out of a larger group, some considered
as part of this group: The term “partitive plural” may point in the same
direction. However, I will for the most part leave the partitive plural alone
throughout this course. Its function just isn’t well enough understood for me
to construct exercises that would only mean feeding some highly tentative
interpretation to unsuspecting students. (I present some thoughts about the
-li plural in the appendices to this course.)
For now we will deal with the “normal” plural form instead. Any reader of
Tolkien’s narratives will have encountered plenty of examples of this form;
they are especially common in the Silmarillion. Nouns ending in any of
the four vowels -a, -o, -i or -u , plus nouns ending in the group -i¨
e, form
their plural with the ending -r. Cf. the names of various groups of people
mentioned in the Silmarillion:
66


Elda “Elf”, plural Eldar
Vala “god (or technically angel)”, pl. Valar
Ainu “spirit of God’s ﬁrst creation”, pl. Ainur
Noldo “Noldo, member of the Second Clan of the Eldar”, pl. Noldor
Vali¨
e “female Vala”, pl. Valier
For another example of -i¨
e, cf. tier for “paths” in Nam´
ari¨
e; compare
singular ti¨
e “path”. (According to the spelling conventions here employed,
the diaeresis in ti¨
e is dropped in the plural form tier because the dots
are there merely to mark that ﬁnal -¨
e is not silent, but in tier, e is not
ﬁnal anymore because an ending has been added – and hence the dots go.)
Examples of the plurals of nouns in -i are rare, since nouns with this ending
are rare themselves, but in MR:229 we have quendir as the pl. of quendi
“Elf-woman” (and also quendur as the pl. of quendu “Elf-man”; nouns in
-u are not very numerous either).
This singular word quendi “Elf-woman” must not be confused with the
plural word Quendi that many readers of Tolkien’s ﬁction will remember
from the Silmarillion, for instance in the description of the awakening of the
Elves in chapter 3: “Themselves they named the Quendi, signifying those
that speak with voices; for as yet they had met no other living things that
spoke or sang.” Quendi is the plural form of Quend¨
e “Elf”; nouns ending
in -¨
e typically form their plurals in -i, and as we see, this -i replaces the
ﬁnal -¨
e instead of being added to it. In WJ:361, Tolkien explicitly refers to
“nouns in -e, the majority of which formed their plurals in -i”.
As this wording implies, there are exceptions; a few nouns in -¨
e are seen
to use the other plural ending, -r, instead. One exception we have already
touched on: where the -¨
e is part of -i¨
e, we have plurals in -ier, as in tier
“paths”. Hence we avoid the awkward plural form **tii. Other exceptions
cannot be explained as easily. In LotR Appendix E, we have tyeller for
“grades”, evidently the plural of tyell¨
e. Why tyeller instead of **tyelli?
LR:47 likewise indicates that the plural of mall¨
e “road” is maller; why not
**malli? It may be that nouns in -l¨
e have plurals in -ler because “regular”
**-li might cause confusion with the partitive plural ending -li mentioned
above. Unfortunately, we lack more examples that could conﬁrm or disprove
this theory (and so I don’t dare to construct any exercises based on this as-
sumption, though I would follow this rule in my own Quenya compositions).
The form tyeller confused early researchers; with extremely few examples to
go on, some wrongly concluded that nouns in -¨
e regularly have plurals in -er.
The name of the early journal Parma Eldalamberon or “Book of Elven-
tongues” (sporadically published still) reﬂects this mistake; the title incorpo-
rates **lamber as the presumed plural of lamb¨
e “tongue, language”, while
we now know that the correct plural must be lambi. Though the error
was early suspected and is now recognized by everyone, the publisher never
bothered to change the name of the journal to the correct form Parma El-
67


dalambion (and so, ever and anon, I get an e-mail from some fresh student
wondering why my site is called Ardalambion and not Ardalamberon. . . )
In some cases, Tolkien himself seems uncertain which plural ending should
be used. In PM:332, the plural form of Ingw¨
e “Elf of the First Clan [also
name of the king of that clan]” is given as Ingwi, just as we would expect;
yet a few pages later, in PM:340, we ﬁnd Ingwer instead (it is there said
that the First Clan, the Vanyar, called themselves Ingwer, so perhaps this
reﬂects a special Vanyarin usage?) It may be noted that in Tolkien’s earliest
“Qenya”, more nouns in -¨
e apparently had plural forms in -er. For instance,
the early poem Narqelion has lasser as the plural of lass¨
e “leaf”, but in
Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR Tolkien used the plural form lassi.
As far as I know, the words in the exercises below all follow the normal
rule: Nouns ending in -¨
e, except as a part of -i¨
e, have plurals in -i.
This leaves only one group of nouns to be considered, namely those that
end in a consonant. These nouns, just like those that end in -¨
e, are seen to
have plurals in -i. A few examples: Eleni “stars”, the plural form of elen
“star”, occurs in Nam´
ari¨
e (and also in WJ:362, where both the singular and
the plural form are quoted). The Silmarillion has Atani for “Men” (not
“males”, but humans as opposed to Elves); this is formed from the singular
word Atan. According to WJ:388, the word Casar “Dwarf” has the plural
Casari “Dwarves”.
Of these two plural endings – r as in Eldar “Elves”, but i as in Atani
“(Mortal) Men” – Tolkien imagined the latter to be the most ancient. The
plural ending -i comes directly from Primitive Elvish -ˆ
ı, a word like Quendi
representing primitive Kwendˆ
ı. The plural ending -r arose later: “For the
showing of many the new device of r was brought in and used in all words
of a certain shape – and this, it is said, was begun among the Noldor”
(PM:402). In primary-world terms, both plural endings were however present
in Tolkien’s conception from the beginning; already in his earliest work on
“Qenya”, written during World War I, we ﬁnd forms like Qendi (as it was
then spelt) and Eldar coexisting. The twin plural endings are a feature
that evidently survived throughout all the stages of Tolkien’s development
of Quenya, from 1915 to 1973.
NOTE ON THE DIFFERENT WORDS FOR “ELF”: As the attentive reader will have
inferred from the above, there is more than one Quenya word for “Elf”. The word with the
widest application, within the scope of Tolkien’s ﬁction, was Quend¨
e pl. Quendi. This
form is at least associated with the word “to speak” (quet-), and Tolkien speculated that
ultimately these words were indeed related via a very primitive base kwe- having to do
with vocal speech (see WJ:391–392). When the Elves awoke by the mere of Cuivi´
enen, they
called themselves Quendi (or in primitive Elvish actually Kwendˆ
ı) since for a long time
they knew of no other speaking creatures. Eventually the Vala Orom¨
e found them under a
starlit sky, and he gave them a new name in the language they themselves had developed:
Eldˆ
ai, often translated “Starfolk”. In Quenya, this primitive word later appeared as Eldar
(singular Elda). While the term Eldar (Eldˆ
ai) was originally meant to apply to the entire
68


Elvish race, it was later only used of the Elves that accepted the invitation of the Valar to
come and dwell in the Blessed Realm of Aman and embarked on the Great March to get
there (the term Eldar is also applicable to those who never actually made it all the way to
Aman, such as the Sindar or Grey-elves who stayed in Beleriand). Those who refused the
invitation were called Avari, “Refusers”, and hence all Elves (Quendi) can be subdivided
into Eldar and Avari. Only the former play any important part in Tolkien’s narratives.
So in later Quenya the situation was this: Quend¨
e pl. Quendi remained as the only truly
universal term for all Elves of any kind, but this was a technical word primarily used by the
Loremasters, not a word that would be used in daily speech. The gender-speciﬁc variants
of Quend¨
e “Elf”, namely masculine quendu and feminine quendi, would presumably
be used only if you wanted to speak of a speciﬁcally Elvish (wo)man as opposed to a
(wo)man of any other sentient race: These are not the normal Quenya words for “man”
and “woman” (the normal words are n´
er and n´
ıs, presumably applicable to a man or
woman of any sentient race, not just Elves). The normal, everyday Quenya term for “Elf”
was Elda, and the fact that this word technically didn’t apply to Elves of the obscure
Avarin tribes living somewhere far east in Middle-earth was no big problem since none
of them was ever seen anyway. Regarding the compound Eldali¨
e (which combines Elda
with li¨
e “people, folk”) Tolkien wrote that when one of the Elves of Aman used this
word, “he meant vaguely all the race of Elves, though he was probably not thinking of
the Avari” (WJ:374). – Throughout the exercises found in this course, I have used Elda
(rather than Quend¨
e) as the standard translation of English “Elf”, regardless of any
specialized meaning it may have within Tolkien’s mythos. As I said in the Introduction,
in these exercises I largely eschew speciﬁc references to Tolkien’s mythos and narratives.
2.2
The article
We have time for one more thing in this lesson: the article. An article,
linguistically speaking, is such a word as English “the” or “a, an”. These
little words are used in conjunction with nouns to express such diﬀerent
shades of meaning as “a horse” vs. “the horse”. Anyone capable of reading
this text in the ﬁrst place will know what the diﬀerence is, so no lengthy
explanation is necessary. In short, “a horse” refers to a horse that hasn’t been
mentioned before, so you slip in the article “a” as a kind of introduction:
“Look, there’s a horse over there!” You may also use the phrase “a horse”
if you want to say something that is true of any horse, as in “a horse is
an animal”. If, on the other hand, you say “the horse”, it usually refers to
one deﬁnite horse. Hence “the” is termed the deﬁnite article, while “a, an”,
lacking this “deﬁnite” aspect, is conversely called the indeﬁnite article.
In this respect at least, Quenya is somewhat simpler than English. Quenya
has only one article, corresponding to the English deﬁnite article “the” (and
since there is no indeﬁnite article it must be distinguished from, we may
simply speak of “the article” when discussing Quenya). The Quenya word
corresponding to English “the” is i. For instance, Nam´
ari¨
e has i eleni for
69


“the stars”. As can be inferred from the above, Quenya has no word cor-
responding to English “a, an”. When translating Quenya into English, one
simply has to slip in “a” wherever English grammar demands an indeﬁ-
nite article, as in the famous greeting Elen s´
ıla l´
umenn’ omentielvo, “a
star shines upon the hour of our meeting”. As we see, the ﬁrst word of the
Quenya sentence is simply elen “star”, with nothing corresponding to the
English indeﬁnite article “a” before it (or anywhere else in the sentence, for
that matter). In Quenya, there is no way you can maintain the distinction
between “a star” and just “star”; both are simply elen. Luckily there isn’t
much of a distinction to be maintained anyway. Languages like Arabic, He-
brew and classical Greek employ a similar system: there is a deﬁnite article
corresponding to English “the”, but nothing corresponding to the English
indeﬁnite article “a, an” (and this is the system used in Esperanto as well).
After all, the absence of the deﬁnite article is itself enough to signal that a
(common) noun is indeﬁnite, so the indeﬁnite article is in a way superﬂuous.
Tolkien decided to do without it in Quenya, so students only have to worry
about i = “the”.
Sometimes, Tolkien connects the article to the next word by means of a
hyphen or a dot: i-mar “the earth” (F´
ıriel’s Song), i·coimas “the lifebread”
(PM:396). However, he did not do so in LotR (we have already quoted the
example i eleni “the stars” in Nam´
ari¨
e), and neither will we here.
The Quenya article is generally used as in English. However, some nouns
that would require the article in English are apparently counted as proper
names in Quenya, and so take no article. For instance, the sentence Anar
caluva tielyanna is translated “the Sun shall shine upon your path” (UT:
22, 51); yet there is no article in the Quenya sentence. “The Sun” is not
**i Anar, but simply Anar. Clearly Anar is perceived as a proper name,
designating one celestial body only, and you don’t have to say “the Anar”
any more than an English-speaking person would say “the Mars”. The name
of “the” Moon, Isil, undoubtedly behaves like Anar in this respect. It may
be noted that both words are treated as proper names in the Silmarillion,
chapter 11: “Isil was ﬁrst wrought and made ready, and ﬁrst rose into the
realm of the stars. . . Anar arose in glory, and the ﬁrst dawn of the Sun was
like a great ﬁre. . . ”
Also notice that before a plural denoting an entire people (or even race),
the article is not normally used. WJ:404 mentions a saying Valar valu-
var, “the will of the Valar will be done” (or more literally *“the Valar will
rule”). Notice that “the Valar” is simply Valar in Quenya, not i Valar.
Similarly, PM:395 has lamb¨
e Quendion for “language of the Elves” and
coimas Eldaron for “coimas [lembas] of the Eldar” – not **lamb¨
e i Quen-
dion, **coimas i Eldaron. (The ending -on here appended to the plurals
Quendi, Eldar signiﬁes “of”; this ending should not aﬀect whether or not
the article has to be present before the word.)
With this usage compare Tolkien’s use of “Men” in his narratives to refer
70


to the human race as such: “Men awoke in Hild´
orien at the rising of the
Sun. . . A darkness lay upon the hearts of Men. . . Men (it is said) were at
ﬁrst very few in number. . . ” (Silmarillion, chapter 17.) By contrast, “the
Men” would refer, not to the entire race, but only to a casual group of
“Men” or humans. Quenya plurals denoting entire peoples or races seem
to behave in the same way. In a Quenya text there would probably be no
article before plurals like Valar, Eldar, Vanyar, Noldor, Lindar, Teleri,
Atani etc. as long as the entire race or people is considered, even though
Tolkien’s English narratives speak of “the Valar”, “the Eldar” etc. However,
if we replace Eldar with its equivalent “Elves”, we see that the article often
would often not be required in English, either (e.g. “Elves are beautiful”
= Eldar nar vany¨
e; if you say “the Elves are beautiful” = i Eldar nar
vany¨
e, you are probably describing once particular group of Elves, not the
entire race).
Occasionally, especially in poetry, the article seemingly drops out for no
special reason. Perhaps it is simply omitted because of metric considera-
tions. The ﬁrst line of Nam´
ari¨
e, ai! lauri¨
e lantar lassi s´
urinen, Tolkien
translated “ah! like gold fall the leaves. . . ” – though there is no i before lassi
“leaves” in the Quenya text. The Markirya poem also leaves out the article
in a number of places, if we are to judge by Tolkien’s English translation of
it.
Summary of Lesson Two
There is a plural ending -li the function of which we don’t fully understand,
so we will leave it alone for now. The normal plural is formed by adding
-r to nouns ending in any of the vowels -a, -i, -o, -u, plus nouns ending
in -i¨
e. If, on the other hand, the noun ends in -¨
e (except, of course, as
part of -i¨
e) the plural ending is usually -i (displacing the ﬁnal -¨
e); nouns
ending in a consonant also form their plurals in -i. The Quenya deﬁnite
article, corresponding to English “the”, is i; there is no indeﬁnite article like
English “a, an”.
Vocabulary
Regarding Frodo hearing Galadriel singing Nam´
ari¨
e, the LotR states that
“as is the way of Elvish words, they remained graven in his memory”. This
may be a comforting thought to students attempting to memorize Quenya
vocabulary. In the lessons proper, while I discuss various aspects of Quenya,
I will normally mention quite a few words – but in the exercises, I will only
use words from the “vocabulary” list that is hereafter presented at the end
of each lesson. Thus, this is all the student is excepted to carefully memorize
(doing the exercises for the next lessons, you will also need vocabulary intro-
71


duced earlier). We will introduce twelve new words in each lesson: a ﬁtting
number, since Tolkien’s Elves preferred counting in twelves rather than tens
as we do. A uniﬁed list of all the vocabulary henceforth employed in the
exercises of this course can be found in Appendix A.
min¨
e “one” (from now on, we will introduce one new number in each lesson)
Anar “(the) Sun”
Isil “(the) Moon”
ar “and” (a most useful word that will allow us to have two exercises in one. . . translate
“the Sun and the Moon”, for instance. . . )
Elda “Elf”
li¨
e “people” (sc. an entire “ethnic group” or even race, as in Eldali¨
e = the People of
the Elves).
vend¨
e “maiden”(in archaic Quenya wend¨
e)
rocco “horse” (speciﬁcally “swift horse for riding”, according to Letters:382
aran “king”
t´
ari “queen”
tasar “willow” (by its form this could be the plural of **tasa, but no such word
exists, and -r is here part of the basic word and not an ending. This word occurs,
compounded, in LotR – Treebeard chanting “In the willow-meads of Tasarinan
[Willow-vale] I walked in the spring. . . ”)
nu “under”

Lesson 3
Dual number. Stem variation.
3.1
Dual number
The previous lesson covered two Quenya plural forms: the somewhat mys-
terious “partitive plural” in -li, and the “normal” plural in either -r or -i
(mostly depending on the shape of the word). Like quite a few “real” lan-
guages, Quenya also possesses a dual form, that has no direct counterpart
in English. Dual number refers to two things, a couple of things. The dual
is formed with one out of two endings: -u or -t.
Within the ﬁctional timeline imagined by Tolkien, these two endings orig-
inally had somewhat diﬀerent meanings, and so were not completely inter-
changeable. A footnote in Letters:427 provides some information on this.
The ending -u (from Primitive Elvish -ˆ
u) was originally used in the case
of natural pairs, of two things or persons somehow belonging together as a
logical couple. For instance, according to VT39:9, 11, the word p´
e “lip” has
the dual form peu “lips”, referring to one person’s pair of lips (and not,
for instance, to the upper lip of one person and the lower lip of another,
which would be just “two lips” and not a natural pair). The noun veru,
meaning “married pair” or “husband and wife”, has dual form; in this case
there does not seem to be a corresponding singular “spouse” (but we have
verno “husband” and vess¨
e “wife” from the same root; see LR:352). The
noun alda “tree” occurs in dual form with reference, not to any casual pair
of trees, but the Two Trees of Valinor: Aldu.
Notice that if the ending -u is added to a noun ending in a vowel, this vowel
is displaced: hence the dual of alda is aldu rather than **aldau – though
a word quoted in PM:138, reproducing a draft for the LotR Appendices,
seems to suggest that Tolkien for a moment considered precisely the latter
form. There is also an old source that has Aldaru, apparently formed by
adding the dual ending -u to the normal plural aldar “trees”, but this seems
to be an early experiment of Tolkien’s that was probably long obsolete by
the time he wrote LotR. In the dual form peu, the ﬁnal vowel of p´
e “lip”
is apparently not displaced by the dual ending -u. However, Quenya p´
e is
74


meant to descend from primitive Elvish pe˜
ne, whereas the dual form peu
is meant to come from pe˜
nˆ
u (VT39:9) – so the e of peu was not originally
ﬁnal.
As for the other dual ending, -t, it according to Letters:427 represents an
old element ata. This, Tolkien noted, was originally “purely numerative”;
it is indeed related to the Quenya word for the numeral “two”, atta. By
“purely numerative”, Tolkien evidently meant that the dual in -t could de-
note two things only casually related. For instance, ciryat as the dual form
of cirya “ship” could refer to any two ships; ciryat would only be a kind
of spoken shorthand for the full phrase atta ciryar, “two ships”. However,
Tolkien further noted that “in later Q[uenya]”, the dual forms were “only
usual with reference to natural pairs”. Precisely what he means by “later”
Quenya cannot be determined; it could refer to Quenya as a ritual language
in Middle-earth rather than the vernacular of the Eldar in Valinor. In any
case, the Third Age Quenya we aim for in this course must certainly be
included when Tolkien speaks of “later” Quenya, so here we will follow the
rule that any dual form must refer to some kind of natural or logical pair,
not to two things only casually related. In other words, the dual in -t came
to have just the same “meaning” as a dual in -u. A dual like ciryat “2
ships” (curiously spelt “ciriat” in Letters:427, perhaps a typo) would not in
later Quenya be used with reference to any two ships, but only of two ships
that somehow form a pair – like two sister ships. If you just want to refer
to two ships that do not in any way form a natural or logical pair, like any
two ships that happen to be seen together, you would not use the dual form
but simply the numeral atta “two” – hence atta ciryar.
Since the two endings -t and -u had come to carry the same meaning,
some rule is needed to determine when to use which. Which ending should
be used can apparently be inferred from the shape of the word itself (just like
the shape of the word normally determines whether the plural ending should
be -i or -r). In Letters:427, Tolkien noted that “the choice of t or u [was]
decided by euphony”, sc. by what sounded well – adding as an example that
-u was preferred to -t if the word that is to receive a dual ending already
contains a t or the similar sound d. Hence the dual of alda is aldu rather
than **aldat. It seems that as far as later Quenya is concerned, -t would
be your ﬁrst option as the dual ending, but if the noun it is to be added
to already contains t or d, you opt for -u instead (remembering that this
ending displaces any ﬁnal vowels). The duals Tolkien listed in the Plotz
Letter, ciryat “a couple of ships” and lasset “a couple of leaves” (formed
from cirya “ship” and lass¨
e “leaf”) conﬁrm that a words with no t or
d in them take the dual ending -t. Perhaps the ending -u would also be
preferred in the case of nouns ending in a consonant, since -t could not be
added directly to such a word without producing a ﬁnal consonant cluster
that Quenya phonology wouldn’t allow; unfortunately we have no examples.
(If the ending -t is to be used anyhow, a vowel would probably have to be
75


inserted before it, producing a longer ending – likely -et. We will eschew this
little problem in the exercises below, since nobody really knows the answer.)
It is clear, however, that Quenya has a number of old duals that do not
follow the rule that the ending is normally -t, replaced by -u only if there is
a d or t in the word it is to be added to. The examples veru “married pair”
and peu “lips, pair of lips” are proof of that; here there is no t or d present,
but the ending is still -u rather than -t. Presumably these are “fossilized”
dual forms reﬂecting the older system in which only -u denoted a natural or
logical pair. The example peu “(pair of) lips” suggests that the ending -u
is used in the case of body-parts occurring in pairs, such as eyes, arms, legs.
(The other ending -t may however be used if certain other endings intrude
before the dual ending itself; we will return to this in a later lesson.) The
word for “arm” is ranco; the dual form denoting one person’s pair of arms
is not attested, but my best guess is that it would be rancu. The compound
hendumaica “sharp-eye[d]” mentioned in WJ:337 may incorporate a dual
hendu “(pair of) eyes”. The Quenya word for “eye” is known to be hen, or
hend- before an ending (the Etymologies only mentions the normal plural
hendi “eyes”, LR:364). In the case of this word the dual ending would be
-u rather than -t anyway, since there is a d in hend-. The word for “foot”,
t´
al, probably has the dual talu (for the shortening of the vowel, see below).
3.2
Stem variation
This is a subject we shall have to spend some paragraphs on, since even on
this early stage of the course we haven’t been able to wholly eschew it. I will
go into some detail here, but students can rest assured that they are not
expected to remember all the words and examples below; just try to get a
feel for what stem variation is all about.
Sometimes the form of a Quenya word subtly changes when you add
endings to it. Two such words were mentioned above. If you add an ending
to t´
al “foot”, for instance -i for plural or -u for dual, the long vowel ´
a is
shortened to a. So the plural “feet” is tali rather than **t´
ali, the dual “a
couple of feet” is talu rather than **t´
alu. In such a case, t´
al “foot” may be
said to have the stem tal-. Likewise, the word hen “eye” has the stem hend-
, since its plural is hendi and not just **heni. The “stem” form does not
occur by itself, but is the form you add endings to. When presenting a gloss,
I will represent such stem variation by listing the independent form ﬁrst,
followed by a parenthetical “stem form” with a hyphen where the ending
goes, e.g.: t´
al (tal-) “foot”, hen (hend-) “eye”.
In the case of t´
al vs. tal-, the variation is apparently due to the fact
that vowels were often lengthened in words of only one syllable, but when
the word had endings the word obviously got more than one syllable and
so the lengthening did not occur (another example of the same seems to be
76


n´
er “man” vs. plural neri “men”, MR:213/LR:354). Originally, the vowel
was short in all forms. It is usually true that the stem form gives away
how the word looked at an earlier stage in the long linguistic evolution
Tolkien dreamed up in great detail. Hen “eye” in its stem hend- reﬂects
the primitive “base” khen-d-e from which it is ultimately derived (LR:364).
Quenya could not have -nd at the end of a word and simpliﬁed it to -n when
the word stands alone (thus, hen in a way represents the impossible “full”
form hend), but before an ending the group -nd- was not ﬁnal and could
therefore actually appear. Very often stem variation has to do with clusters
or sounds that are not allowed at the end of words, but that may appear
elsewhere. Cf. a word like talan “ﬂoor”. The plural “ﬂoors” is not **talani
as we might expect, but talami. The stem is talam- because this is the form
of the Primitive Elvish root-word: talam (LR:390). As Quenya evolved
from Primitive Elvish, a rule came into place that only a few consonants
were allowed at the end of words, and m was not one of them. The closest
“permissible” consonant was n, and so the old word talam was altered to
talan – but in the plural form talami (and other forms that added an
ending to the word), the m was not ﬁnal and therefore persisted unchanged.
Another, similar case is ﬁlit “small bird”, that has the stem ﬁlic- (e.g.
plural ﬁlici “small birds”): The primitive root-word was philik (LR:381),
but Quenya did not permit -k at the end of a word, so in that position it
became -t. When not ﬁnal it remained k (here spelt c).
In some cases, the “independent” form is a simpliﬁed or shortened form
of a word, while the stem form reﬂects the fuller form. For instance, Tolkien
apparently imagined that the word merend¨
e “feast, festival” was often
shortened to meren, but the stem is still merend- (LR:372). Hence the
plural of meren is merendi, not **mereni. When it stands alone, the
word niss¨
e “woman” is normally reduced to nis (or n´
ıs with a lengthened
vowel), but the double S persists before endings: thus the plural “women”
is nissi (LR:377, MR:213). A similar case is Silmarill¨
e, the name of one
of the legendary jewels created by F¨
eanor; this is normally shortened to
Silmaril, but before endings the double L of the full form is preserved
(Silmarill-); hence the plural is always Silmarilli. In the case of compound
words, sc. words made up from several other words, the second element in
the compound is often reduced, but a fuller form may turn up before an
ending. For instance, the noun Sindel “Grey-elf” (WJ:384) incorporates -el
as a reduced form of Elda “Elf”. The plural of Sindel is not **Sindeli,
but Sindeldi preserving the cluster -ld- seen in Elda. (Since the ﬁnal -a is
lost in the compound, we cannot have the plural **Sindeldar.)
In some cases a word may be contracted when you add endings to it. In
such cases the stem-form does not reﬂect the older, more complete form
of the word. Such contraction often occurs in two-syllable words containing
two identical vowels. For instance, feren “beech-tree” is reduced to fern-
before an ending, e.g. plural ferni instead of **fereni. WJ:416 likewise
77


indicates that laman “animal” may be reduced to lamn- before an ending,
hence for instance lamni “animals”, though the unreduced form lamani
was also in use. Occasionally, the contracted forms suﬀer further change
when compared to the unreduced form; as the plural of seler “sister” we
might expect **selri, but since lr is not a permissible consonant cluster in
Quenya, it is changed to ll – the actual plural “sisters” being selli (LR:392).
Another form of stem-variation is very poorly attested as far as nouns
are concerned, but there are hints to the eﬀect that the ﬁnal vowel of some
words would change when an ending is added. In Quenya, the ﬁnal vowels
-o and -¨
e sometimes come from -u and -i in Primitive Elvish. At one stage
of the linguistic evolution, original short -i became -e when the vowel was
ﬁnal; in the same environment original short -u became -o. For instance, the
primitive word tundu “hill, mound” came out as tundo in Quenya (LR:395).
But since this change only occurred when the vowel was ﬁnal, it is possible
that its original quality would be preserved before an ending. The plural
“hills” may well be tundur rather than tundor, though neither form is at-
tested. According to SD:415, the Quenya noun l´
om¨
e “night” has the “stem”
l´
omi-, evidently meaning that the ﬁnal vowel -¨
e changes to -i- if you add an
ending after it. For instance, adding the dual ending -t to l´
om¨
e (to express
“a couple of nights”) would presumably produce l´
omit rather than l´
omet.
This would be because l´
om¨
e comes from Primitive Elvish dˆ
omi (LR:354),
and -i never turned into -e except when ﬁnal. Some think certain words in
Nam´
ari¨
e, l´
ırinen and s´
urinen, are attested examples of this phenomenon:
These are forms of l´
ır¨
e “song” and s´
ur¨
e “wind” (the latter is attested by it-
self in MC:222; the meaning of the ending -nen seen in l´
ırinen and s´
urinen
will be discussed in a later lesson). If this word originally ended in an -i that
became -¨
e only later (and only when ﬁnal), it may explain why in this word
-¨
e seemingly turns into -i- before an ending. We would then say that s´
ur¨
e
has the stem s´
uri-.
There seems to be a similar variation between involving the ﬁnal vowel
-o, that in some cases descend from ﬁnal -u in Primitive Elvish; again the
primitive quality of the vowel may be resurrected if an ending is added to
it. For instance, rusco “fox” is said to have the stem ruscu-, so if we add
the dual ending to speak of a “a couple of foxes”, the resulting form should
presumably be ruscut rather than ruscot. However, there is no extensive
treatment of this phenomenon in Tolkien’s published writings; indeed the
statements made in SD:415 and VT41:10 that l´
om¨
e and rusco have stems
l´
omi-, ruscu- are as close as we get to explicit references to it.
The student should not despair, thinking that all sorts of strange things
typically happen whenever you add an ending to a Quenya word, so that
there is a great potential for making embarrassing mistakes (or at least very
much extra stuﬀto memorize). Most Quenya words seem to be quite well-
behaved, with no distinct “stem” form to remember; you just add the ending
and that’s it. Where a distinct stem-form is known to exist (or where we
78


have good reason to suspect one), this will of course be indicated when I
ﬁrst present the word, if it is relevant for the exercises.
Summary of Lesson Three
In addition to the plural form(s), Quenya also has a dual number used
for a pair of things forming some kind of natural or logical couple. (We
must assume that two things only casually associated would be denoted by
a normal plural in conjunction with the numeral atta “two”.) The dual
is formed with one out of two endings: -t or -u (the latter displaces ﬁnal
vowels; the dual of alda “tree” is therefore aldu rather than aldau). One’s
ﬁrst choice seems to be -t, but if the word this ending is to be added to
already contains a t or a d, the alternative ending -u is preferred instead
(for reasons of euphony – if you like, to avoid “crowding” the word with t’s
or similar sounds!) However, there seems to be a number of old, “fossilized”
dual forms that end in -u even though there is no d or t in the word, such
as veru “married pair” and peu “pair of lips”. The latter example may
suggest that all body-parts occurring in pairs are denoted by dual forms in
-u rather than -t, regardless of the shape of the word (though the ending -t
is evidently preferred if other endings intrude before the dual ending itself;
more on this later).
Quite a few Quenya words subtly change when endings are appended to
them, e.g. talan “ﬂoor” turning into talam- in the plural form talami. We
would then call talam- the stem form of talan. Similarly, the ﬁnal vowels -o
and -¨
e sometimes appear as -u- and -i-, respectively, if some ending is added;
thus l´
om¨
e “night” has the stem l´
omi-. In many cases, the stem-form echoes
the older shape of words (sounds or combinations that could not survive at
the end of a word being preserved where not ﬁnal), though the stem-form
may also represent a contraction.

Lesson 4
The Adjective. The Copula. Adjectival agreement in number.
4.1
The Adjective
The vocabulary of any language can be separated into various classes of
words – various parts of speech. Tolkien’s languages were designed to be
“deﬁnitely of a European kind in style and structure” (Letters:175), so the
parts of speech they contain are not very exotic, but ought to be quite fa-
miliar to any schoolchild in Europe or America. We have already mentioned
the nouns, which by a somewhat simpliﬁed deﬁnition are words denoting
things. Now we will move on to the adjectives.
Adjectives are words that have assumed the special function of description.
If you want to say that someone or something possesses a certain quality,
you can often ﬁnd an adjective that will do the job. In a sentence like the
house is red, the word “red” is an adjective. It describes the house. There
are adjectives for all sorts of qualities, quite useful if you want to say that
someone or something is big, small, holy, blue, silly, rotten, beautiful, thin,
nauseous, tall, wonderful, obnoxious or whatever the occasion demands.
One often distinguishes two diﬀerent ways of using an adjective:
1. You can team it up with a noun which it then describes, resulting in
phrases like tall men or (a/the) red book. Such phrases can then be inserted
into a full sentence, like tall men scare me or the red book is mine, where
the words tall, red simply provide extra information about their companion
nouns. This is called using the adjective attributively. The quality in question
is presented as an “attribute” of the noun, or is “attributed” to it (tall men
– OK, then we know precisely what kind of men we are talking about here,
the tall ones, their tallness being their “attribute”).
2. But you may also construct sentences where the whole point is that
someone or something possesses a speciﬁc quality. You don’t just “presup-
pose” the tallness as when you speak of tall men – you want to say that the
men are tall, that’s the very piece of information you want to convey. This is
called using an adjective predicatively: You choose a party you want to say
something about, like the men in this case, and then add an adjective to tell
81


what quality this party possesses. The adjective is then called the predicate
of this sentence.
As the attentive reader already suspects from the example above, there is
one more complication: You don’t just say the men tall, but the men are tall.
Actually sentences like the men tall would be quite OK in a great number
of languages (and Quenya may even be one of them), but in English you
have to slip in a word like are or is before the adjective when you use it as
a predicate: The book is red. The men are tall. This “is/are” doesn’t really
add a whole lot of meaning here (there is a reason why so many languages
manage without any corresponding word!), but it is used to “couple” the
adjective with the words that tell us what we are really talking about here –
like the book and the men in our example. Hence “is/are” is called a copula.
In sentences like gold is beautiful, I am smart or stones are hard, it can be
perceived the prime function of the copula (here variously manifesting as is,
am and are) is simply to connect the following adjectives beautiful, smart,
hard with the thing(s) or person we are talking about: gold, I, stones. The
copula is an integral part of the predicate of the sentence. This is one of
the most important constructions speakers or English have at their disposal
when they want to say that X possesses the quality Y.
Well, let’s get down to Quenya here. When compared to the plethora
of shapes that a noun can have, Quenya adjectives are quite restricted in
form. The vast majority of Quenya adjectives end in one of two vowels -a
or -¨
e. The latter ending is the less common and typically occurs in colour-
adjectives: Ninqu¨
e “white”, mor¨
e “black”, carn¨
e “red”, varn¨
e “brown”
etc. When an adjective does not end in -a or -¨
e, it virtually always ends
in -in, e.g. ﬁrin “dead”, hwarin “crooked”, melin “dear” or latin “open,
free, cleared (of land)”. The latter adjective is actually listed as latin(a)
in Tolkien’s writings (LR:368), evidently suggesting that latin is shortened
from a longer form latina, both variants occurring in the language. (Perhaps
all the adjectives in -in are to be considered shortened forms or full forms in
-ina.) Adjectives that do not end in either -a, -¨
e or -in are extremely rare;
there is at least teren “slender” – but even this adjective also has a longer
form in -¨
e (teren¨
e).
Adjectives in -a are by far the most common type. The ﬁnal vowel -a
may appear by itself, as in l´
ara “ﬂat”, but it is often part of a longer ad-
jectival ending like -wa, -na (variant -da), -ima or -ya. Examples: helwa
“(pale) blue”, harna “wounded”, melda “beloved, dear”, melima “love-
able”, vanya “beautiful”. The word Quenya itself is in its origin a ya-
adjective meaning “Elvish, Quendian”, though Tolkien decided that it came
to be used only as a name of the High-elven language (Letters:176, WJ:360–
361, 374).
In Quenya as in English, an adjective can be directly combined with a
noun, describing it. We have many attested examples of adjectives being
used attributively like this; they include the phrases lint¨
e yuldar “swift
82


draughts” (Nam´
ari¨
e), luini tellumar “blue vaults” (prose-style Nam´
ari¨
e),
f´
ana cirya “a white ship” (Markirya), quant¨
e tengwi “full signs” (a term
used by early Elvish linguists; we needn’t discuss its precise meaning here;
see VT39:5). In these examples, the word order is the same as in English:
adjective + noun. This is apparently the normal, preferred order. In Quenya,
it is however also permissible to let the adjective follow the noun. For in-
stance, Markirya has anar p´
ur¨
ea for “a bleared sun”, literally “(a) sun
bleared”, and in LR:47 we have mall¨
e t´
era, literally “road straight”, for
“a straight road” (cf. LR:43). Perhaps this word order is used if you want
to emphasize the adjective: the context in LR:47 indicates that this is a
straight road as opposed to a bent one. However, letting the adjective fol-
low the noun may be the normal word order in the case of an adjectival
“title” that is used in conjunction with a proper name: In UT:305 cf. 317
we have Elendil Voronda for “Elendil the Faithful” (well, the form found
in UT:305 is actually Elendil Vorondo, because the phrase is inﬂected;
we will return to the ending -o here seen in a later lesson). Presumably you
could also use the more normal word-order and speak of voronda Elendil,
but that – I guess – would simply be a more casual reference to “faithful
Elendil”, not meaning “Elendil the Faithful” with the adjective used as a
regular title. It may be noted that Quenya, unlike English, does not insert
the article before an adjective used as a title (not **Elendil i Voronda, at
least not necessarily).
What, then, about using adjectives as predicates, like “red” is the predi-
cate of the sentence “the book is red”? (Contrast the attributive use of the
adjective in a phrase like “the red book”.) The adjective vanwa “lost” is
used predicatively in Nam´
ari¨
e: Vanwa n´
a . . . Valimar “lost is . . . Vali-
mar” (a place in the Blessed Realm that Galadriel thought she would never
see again). This sentence tells us that the Quenya copula “is” has the form
n´
a. Plural “are” seems to be nar, attested in an early version of Nam´
ari¨
e
recorded by Tolkien on tape (see Jim Allan’s An Introduction to Elvish, p.
5). It is generally assumed that these copulas would be used as in English,
for instance like this:
I parma n´
a carn¨
e. “The book is red.”
Ulundo n´
a ´
um¨
ea. “A monster is evil.”
I neri nar hall¨
e. “The men are tall.”
In this lesson as originally published in December 2000, I slipped in a
warning at this point:
I should add, though, that due to the extreme scarcity of exam-
ples we can’t be certain what the preferred word order really is.
From the example vanwa n´
a . . . Valimar “lost is . . . Valimar”
in Nam´
ari¨
e one could argue that n´
a should follow the adjective,
so that “the book is red” should rather be i parma carn¨
e n´
a,
83


“the book red is”. It would be interesting to know if n´
a “is”
would still follow vanwa “lost” if we relocated Valimar to the
beginning of the sentence; should “Valimar is lost” be Valimar
n´
a vanwa, English-style, or perhaps Valimar vanwa n´
a? In
the examples above and the exercises below I have organized the
sentences using the “English” word order, but Tolkien may have
had something more exotic up his sleeve. There is no way of
telling before more material is published.
I revise this lesson in November 2001, and this summer a few more exam-
ples involving the word n´
a “is” ﬁnally became available. There does seem
to be a tendency to place n´
a at the end of the sentence, as in the example
l´
a caritas . . . alasaila n´
a (literally, “not to do it unwise is” – VT42:34).
Yet the same article that provides this example also cites the formula “A n´
a
calima l´
a B” (literally, “A is bright beyond B”) as the Quenya way of ex-
pressing “A is brighter than B” (VT42:32). Notice that this formula employs
an English-style word-order, with n´
a “is” preceding rather than following
calima “bright”. So it seems that sentences like i parma n´
a carn¨
e, word
by word corresponding to English “the book is red”, may be possible after
all. Therefore I have not revised any of the examples or exercises of this
course, all of which employ the “English” word order as far as the copula
n´
a is concerned. It seems, however, that the order i parma carn¨
e n´
a “the
book red is” must be considered a perfectly valid alternative, and Tolkien
may even have intended this to be the more common word order. We must
await still more examples.
[New update, January 2002: This month some new examples were indeed
published. It seems that the exact word order is simply a matter of taste.
The example ely¨
e na manna “thou art blessed” from VT43:26 has an
English-style word order, and here the copula “is/art” appears in the short
form na rather than n´
a. I have however maintained n´
a in the exercises of
this course; the word na has several other, quite distinct meanings. But
perhaps the short form na- is consistently preferred when some ending is to
be added; cf. the plural form nar “are”. Of course, the unattested form n´
ar
could be equally valid for all I know.]
In F´
ıriel’s Song (a pre-LotR text), the word for “is” appears as ye rather
than n´
a or na, as in ´
ırima ye N´
umenor “lovely is N´
umenor” (LR:72).
However, both the Qenya Lexicon (QL:64) and the Etymologies (LR:374)
point to n´
a instead, and in Nam´
ari¨
e we have this word attested in an actual
text. Etym and the QL are earlier than F´
ıriel’s Song, but Nam´
ari¨
e is later,
so would seem that ye was just a passing experiment in Tolkien’s evolution
of Quenya. In F´
ıriel’s Song we also see an ending for “is”, -i¨
e, appended to
adjectives and displacing their ﬁnal vowel: hence in this song we have m´
ari¨
e
for “(it) is good”, derived from the adjective m´
ara “good”. This ending -
i¨
e is transparently related to the independent word ye. I don’t think the
84


system of using the ending -i¨
e for “is” was still valid in LotR-style Quenya,
and I wouldn’t recommend it to writers. The ending -i¨
e has other meanings
in later Quenya.
Another system may well be valid, though: using no copula at all. You
simply juxtapose the noun and the adjective, the word “is/are” being un-
derstood: Ilu vanya “the World [is] fair” (F´
ıriel’s Song), maller raicar
“roads [are] bent” (LR:47). The formula “A is bright beyond B” = “A is
brighter than B” referred to above is actually cited as “A (n´
a) calima l´
a
B” in VT42:32. As suggested by the parentheses, n´
a could be omitted. The
example malle t´
era “a straight road” mentioned above could also be inter-
preted “a road [is] straight”, if the context allowed it. The ﬁnal version of
Tolkien’s Quenya translation of the Hail Mary, published in January 2002,
leaves out several copulas: Aistana ely¨
e, ar aistana i y´
av¨
e m´
onalyo =
“blessed [art] thou, and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb”.
We must assume that the copula n´
a, nar is not limited to combining nouns
and adjectives, but can also be used to equate nouns: Parmar nar engwi
“books are things”, F¨
ean´
aro n´
a Noldo “F¨
eanor is a Noldo”. (Notice, by the
way, that the proper Quenya form of F¨
eanor’s name is F¨
ean´
aro; “F¨
eanor” is
a Quenya-Sindarin hybrid form used in Middle-earth after his death.) Again
it may be permissible to leave out the copula and retain the same meaning:
Parmar nati, F¨
ean´
aro Noldo.
Adjectival agreement in number: Quenya adjectives must agree in number
with the noun they describe. That is, if the noun is plural, the adjective
must be, too; if the adjective describes several nouns it must also be plural,
even if each of the nouns is singular. English makes no such distinction –
its adjectives do not change – but it is not surprising that Tolkien built
adjectival agreement in number into Quenya, since this was to be a highly
inﬂected language.
We have no examples of what happens if an adjective is to agree with a
noun in the dual form (or, for that matter, with a “partitive plural” noun
in -li). It is generally assumed, though, that there are no special dual or
partitive plural forms of adjectives, but only one plural (or should we say
“non-singular”) form.
How, then, is the plural form of adjectives constructed? From the exam-
ples now available, it can be seen that Tolkien experimented with various
systems over the years. In early sources, adjectives in -a form their plural
form by adding the ending -r, just like nouns in -a do. For instance, one very
early “map” of Tolkien’s imaginary world (actually depicted as a symbolic
ship) includes a reference to I Nori Landar. This evidently means “The
Wide Lands” (LT1:84–85; the adjective landa “wide” occurs in the Ety-
mologies, entry lad. Christopher Tolkien in LT1:85 suggests the translation
“The Great Lands”.) Here the plural noun nori “lands” is described by the
adjective landa “wide” – another example of an attributive adjective follow-
ing the noun, by the way – and since the noun is plural, the adjective takes
85


the plural ending -r to agree with it. This way of forming plural adjectives
was still valid as late as 1937 or slightly earlier; we have already quoted the
example maller raicar “roads [are] bent” from LR:47, where the adjective
raica “crooked, bent, wrong” (listed by itself in LR:383) is plural to agree
with maller.
However, this system cannot be recommended to writers; the evidence
is that in LotR-style Quenya, it had been abandoned. Tolkien in a way
reached back into the past and revived a system he had used in what may
be the very ﬁrst “Qenya” poem he ever wrote, Narqelion of 1915–16. In this
poem, adjectives in -a form their plurals by means of the ending -i. For in-
stance, the phrase sangar ´
um¨
eai occurring in this poem apparently means
“throngs large” = large throngs; the adjective ´
um¨
ea “large” is listed in the
early Qenya Lexicon (QL:97 – but in later Quenya, the word ´
um¨
ea means
“evil” instead). Later, Tolkien however introduced one more complication:
Adjectives in -a had plurals in -ai in archaic Quenya only. In Exilic Quenya,
Quenya as spoken by the Noldor after they had returned to Middle-earth,
-ai at the end of words of more than one syllable had been reduced to -¨
e. (Cf.
WJ:407 regarding the ending -v¨
e representing “archaic Q -vai”.) So while
the plural form of, say, quanta “full” was apparently quantai at the older
stages of the language, it later became quant¨
e. This form we have already
met in one of the examples quoted above: quant¨
e tengwi, “full signs”,
where quanta appears in the plural form to agree with tengwi “signs”
(VT39:5).
There is one special case to be considered: adjectives in -¨
ea, such as laur¨
ea
“golden”. In archaic Quenya, we must assume that the plural form was
simply laur¨
eai. But when -ai later became -e, what would be ?laur¨
ee did
not prove to be a durable form. To avoid the cumbersome combination of
two concomitant e’s, the ﬁrst of them was changed to i. Hence the plural
form of laur¨
ea in Exilic Quenya appears as lauri¨
e, as in the ﬁrst line of
Nam´
ari¨
e: Ai! lauri¨
e lantar lassi s´
urinen. . . “Ah! golden fall the leaves in
the wind. . . ” – the adjective being plural to agree with the noun it describes,
lassi “leaves”.
As for adjectives in -¨
e, they seem to behave like most nouns of the same
shape: -¨
e becomes -i in the plural. We don’t have very many examples, but
the phrase luini tellumar “blue vaults” in the prose version of Nam´
ari¨
e
seems to incorporate the plural form of an adjective luin¨
e “blue” (actually
not attested in this form, but as observed above, there are many colour-
adjectives in -¨
e). Moreover, in the Etymologies Tolkien noted that the an
adjective mait¨
e “handy, skilled” has the plural form maisi (LR:371). Evi-
dently the plural form was especially mentioned primarily to illustrate an-
other point: that adjectives in -it¨
e have plural forms in -isi, the consonant
t turning into s before i. This particular idea seems to have been dropped
later, though: In a much later, post-LotR source, Tolkien wrote hlon´
ıti
tengwi, not ?hlon´
ısi tengwi, for “phonetic signs” (WJ:395). So perhaps
86


the plural form of mait¨
e could simply be ?maiti as well.
As for the plural form of adjectives ending in a consonant, such as ﬁrin
“dead”, we don’t seem to have any examples to guide us. It has traditionally
been assumed that they form their plurals in -i, just like nouns of this shape
do, and this still seems reasonably plausible. So, say, “dead men” could be
ﬁrini neri. If any argument can be raised against this assumption, it is that
adjectives in -in actually seem to be shortened forms of longer adjectives in
-ina. As pointed out above, Tolkien quoted the adjective meaning “open,
free, cleared (of land)” as latin(a), indicating double forms latin and latina.
The plural form of latina should obviously be latin¨
e, for older latinai. But
what about latin? If this is merely a shortened form of latina, perhaps the
plural form would still be latin¨
e rather than latini? We cannot know for
certain; in the exercises below I have followed the traditional assumption,
using plurals in -i. Adjectives ending in a consonant are quite rare anyway, so
this uncertainty does not greatly jeopardize the quality of our own Quenya
texts.
In what positions do adjectives agree in number? Attested examples like
those already quoted, like luini tellumar “blue domes”, would seem to indi-
cate that an attributive adjective in front of the noun does show agreement.
So does an attributive adjective following the noun; the Markirya poem
has i fairi n´
ec¨
e for “the pale phantoms”, or literally “the phantoms pale”
(n´
eca pl. n´
ec¨
e “vague, faint, dim to see”, MC:223). An adjective separated
from the noun it describes also agrees in number, hence laur¨
ea “golden” ap-
pears in plural form lauri¨
e in the ﬁrst line of Nam´
ari¨
e, lauri¨
e lantar lassi
“golden fall leaves” (the prose Nam´
ari¨
e has lassi lantar lauri¨
e “leaves fall
golden”). As for predicative adjectives, we lack late examples. In German,
adjectives do agree in number when they are used attributively, but adjec-
tives used predicatively do not. Yet the old example maller raicar “roads
[are] bent” in LR:47 would seem to indicate that in Quenya, adjectives agree
in number also when they are used predicatively. In later Quenya we should
presumably read maller (nar) raic¨
e, since Tolkien changed the rules for
how the plural form of adjectives is constructed.
So in short, we can conclude that adjectives agree in number with the
nouns they describe “everywhere” – whether they appear before, after or
separated from the noun, whether they are used attributively or predica-
tively. There are a few examples that don’t quite ﬁt in, though. Appendix E
of the essay Quendi and Eldar of ca. 1960 contains several “well-behaved”
examples of plural adjectives that are used attributively with the plural
noun tengwi “signs”, making up various phrases used by early Elvish lin-
guists when they tried to analyze the structure of their tongue (as I said
above, we needn’t concern ourselves with the precise meaning of these terms
here). Besides hlon´
ıti tengwi “phonetic signs” and quant¨
e tengwi “full
signs” already quoted (WJ:395, VT39:5), we have racin¨
e tengwi “stripped
signs” and peny¨
e tengwi “lacking signs” (VT39:6; the singular of the latter,
87


penya tengw¨
e “a lacking sign”, is attested: VT39:19). In these phrases the
adjectives hlon´
ıt¨
e “phonetic”, quanta “full”, racina “stripped, deprived”
and penya “lacking, inadequate” all assume their plural forms, beautifully
agreeing with tengwi “signs, elements, sounds”. So far, so good. But then
we turn to the draft material for Appendix E of Quendi and Eldar. Here
Tolkien did not let the adjectives agree in number, and we have phrases
like lehta tengwi “free/released elements”, sarda tengwi “hard sounds”
and tapta tengwi “impeded elements” (VT39:17). We would of course ex-
pect leht¨
e tengwi, sard¨
e tengwi, tapt¨
e tengwi, but these are not found.
Unless we are to assume that there are several classes of adjectives, some
that agree in number and others that don’t – and I think this is rather far-
fetched – it seems that Tolkien in the draft material used a system whereby
an attributive adjective immediately in front of its noun does not agree in
number. But when he actually wrote the Appendix, he would seem to have
introduced agreement in this position as well, and so we have for instance
quant¨
e tengwi rather than ?quanta tengwi for “full signs”. Elvish gram-
mar could change at lightening speed whenever Tolkien was in his “revision”
mood, so this would not be surprising.
The last version of the Markirya poem, which Christopher Tolkien thinks
was written at some point in the last decade of his father’s life (1963–73), is
also relevant here. In the phrase “fallen towers”, Tolkien ﬁrst wrote the adjec-
tive atalant¨
ea “ruinous, downfallen” in its plural form atalanti¨
e, just like
we would expect. Then, according to Christopher Tolkien, he mysteriously
changed atalanti¨
e to the singular (or rather uninﬂected) form atalant¨
ea,
though the adjacent noun “towers” was left in the plural (MC:222). Again
Tolkien seems to be experimenting with a system whereby attributive adjec-
tives immediately in front of the noun they describe do not agree in number,
but appear in their uninﬂected form. A similar system appears in Tolkien’s
writings on Westron, the “Common Speech” of Middle-earth (a language he
only sketched). Perhaps he considered introducing such a system in Quenya
as well, and we see this idea ﬂickering on and oﬀ, so to speak, in his writings?
However, the system I would recommend to writers is to let adjectives
agree in number also in this position. In Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR we have the
phrase lint¨
e yuldar “swift draughts”, and in the interlinear translation
in RGEO:66 Tolkien explicitly noted that lint¨
e is a “pl.” adjective. We
must assume, then, that lint¨
e represents older lintai, the plural form of an
adjective linta. If an attributive adjective immediately in front of the noun
it describes did not agree in number, “swift draughts” should have been
?linta yuldar instead. The source where Tolkien explicitly identiﬁed lint¨
e
as a plural form was published during his own lifetime, and moreover as late
as in 1968, possibly postdating even the last version of Markirya. So his ﬁnal
decision seems to have been that adjectives do agree in number with their
nouns also when the adjective appears immediately in front of the noun.
One suspects that he spent many sleepless nights carefully considering the
88


various pros and cons in this important question.
NOTE ON ADJECTIVES USED AS NOUNS: As described above, Tolkien at one
stage had adjectives in -a form their plurals in -ar, but later he replaced this with -¨
e
(for older -ai). However, adjectives in -a may still have plural forms in -ar if they are
used as nouns, because in such a case they are naturally inﬂected as nouns. Tolkien noted
that instead of saying peny¨
e tengwi “lacking signs” the Elves might simply refer to the
penyar or “lacking ones” – “using [the adjective] penya as a technical noun” (VT39:19). A
more well-known example is provided by the adjective vanya “fair, beautiful”; this would
normally have the plural form vany¨
e (e.g. vany¨
e nissi “beautiful women”). However, the
adjective vanya can also be used as a noun, “a Vanya” or “Fair One”, which was the word
used of a member of the First Clan of the Eldar. Then the whole clan is of course called
the Vanyar, as in the Silmarillion chapter 3: “The Vanyar were [Ingw¨
e’s] people; they
are the Fair Elves.” Using another (but related) adjective “beautiful”, namely vanima,
Treebeard employed another noun-style plural when he greeted Celeborn and Galadriel as
a vanimar “o beautiful ones” (the translation given in Letters:308).
Adjectives in -¨
e would however have their usual plural form in -i even if they are used
as nouns, since most nouns in -¨
e also form their plurals in -i.
Summary of Lesson Four
Adjectives are words used to describe various qualities, such as “tall” or
“beautiful”. They can be combined with nouns, making up phrases like
“(a/the) red book” or “tall men”, where the adjectives “red” and “tall” de-
scribe the nouns “book” and “men” directly; this is called using an adjective
attributively. But they can also be made to make up sentences like “the book
is red” or “the men are tall”, where the whole point of the sentence is to
ascribe a certain quality to a noun; here the adjective is used as a predicate.
In such cases English slips in a copula, like “is” or “are” in these examples,
to clarify the relationship between the noun and the adjective. Many lan-
guages do without this extra device (one would just say what corresponds
to “the book red”), and this seems to be permissible in Quenya as well, but
the explicit copula n´
a “is”/nar “are” also occurs in the material. – Most
Quenya adjectives end in the vowel -a, some also in -¨
e; the only ones that
end in a consonant are a few that have the ending -in (apparently shortened
from -ina). Quenya adjectives agree in number; if an adjective describes a
plural noun or more than one noun, the adjective must be plural as well.
Adjectives in -a have plural forms in -¨
e (for older -ai); notice that if the
adjective ends in -¨
ea it forms its plural in -i¨
e (to avoid -¨
ee). Adjectives in -¨
e
have plural forms in -i; for the few adjectives in -in we lack examples, but
it is normally assumed that they would add -i in the plural.

Lesson 5
The Verb: Present tense and agreement in number.
Subject/object. The superlative form of adjectives.
5.1
The Verb
As I mentioned at the beginning of the previous lesson, the vocabulary of
any language can be separated into various classes of words, or “parts of
speech”. So far we have explicitly discussed the nouns, which denote things,
and adjectives, which are words used to describe nouns (linguists would
ﬁnd these deﬁnitions rather simplistic, but they will do for our purpose).
Actually we have already touched on a three other parts of speech as well,
without discussing them in depth. As part of Lesson Two you hopefully
memorized the word nu “under”, which is a preposition; prepositions are
small words or “particles” like under, on, of, to, in, about etc., often used to
provide information about spatial relationships (e.g. “under the tree” = nu
i alda), though frequently they are used in more abstract contexts. With
the word ar “and” we have also included the most typical representative of
the conjunctions, words used to connect (or indeed “conjoin”) other words,
phrases or sentences, e.g. Anar ar Isil = “the sun and the moon”. Still, no
thorough discussion of prepositions or conjunctions as such seems necessary:
in Quenya they seem to behave pretty much like their English equivalents,
so for the most part you simply have to learn the corresponding Quenya
words. They are not normally inﬂected in any way.
Another part of speech that we have already touched on is far more sophis-
ticated and intriguing: the verb. We encountered one verb in the previous
lesson: n´
a “is”, with its plural form nar “are”. As verbs go, this one is not
very exciting; it is simply used to coordinate a noun with some sort of pred-
icate that tells us what the noun “is”: Aran n´
a taura, “a king is mighty”,
tasar n´
a alda “a willow is a tree”. As I said in the previous lesson, the cop-
ula n´
a doesn’t really provide much extra information here, except clarifying
the relationship between the various elements of the sentence. Most other
verbs (very nearly all other verbs, actually) are however full of meaning.
They don’t just tell us what someone or something “is”, but what someone
92


or something does. The Verb brings action into the language.
In a sentence like “the Elf dances” it is easy to identify “dances” as the
action-word, telling us what is going on here. And sure enough, “dances” is
a form of the English verb to dance. This verb may appear in other forms
as well; instead of “dances” we might say “danced”, which moves the action
into the past: “The Elf danced.” This illustrates an important feature of
verbs in European languages: the form of the verb gives information about
when the action denoted takes place, in the present or in the past. Some
languages also have special future forms. Tolkien built all of these features
into Quenya.
The diﬀerent “time-forms” of the verb are called various tenses; we speak
of present tense, past tense and future tense. We will only deal with the
present tense in this lesson, and return to the others later. (The trinity of
present, past and future does not represent a full list of all the tenses there
are. We will discuss a total of ﬁve diﬀerent tenses in this course, and I would
be very surprised if unpublished material does not describe even more tenses
than the ones we know at present.)
Here I should slip in a warning: We don’t have much explicit information
about the Quenya verb. In the so-called Plotz Letter, that Tolkien wrote
to Dick Plotz at some point in the mid-sixties, he set out the declension of
the noun. Apparently similar information about the verb was to follow; it
never did. This is of course most unfortunate. Not that Tolkien took this
information to his grave; we know that he did write about these matters, but
the relevant writings have not been published. For the time being, we must
for the most part try to ﬁgure out the grammatical rules by ourselves if we
would like our Quenya poems to include verbs. Regarding the present tense,
some scraps of information luckily appeared in Vinyar Tengwar #41, July
2000. Combining this info with some linguistic deduction, we can probably
make out the main features of the system Tolkien had in mind.
As they appear in various sources, Quenya verbs seem to fall into two main
categories (though there are some verbs in our corpus that don’t readily
ﬁt into either, even if we exclude the early “Qenya” material where some
really weird things are going on in the verbal system). The ﬁrst and largest
category is what can be termed A-stems, for they all end in -a. Another
term for the same is derived verbs, for these verbs never represent a naked
primitive “root-word”, but are derived by adding endings to this root. The
most frequent of these endings are -ya and -ta; much less frequently we see
-na or just -a. Examples:
calya- “to illuminate” (root kal)
tulta- “to send for, to fetch, to summon” (root tul)
harna- “to wound” (root skar; primitive initial sk- became h- in Quenya)
mapa- “to grasp, to seize” (root map)
(Convention has it that when you list verbal stems as such, you add a
93


hyphen at the end; Tolkien usually does so in his writings. The “stem” of a
verb is a basic form that we start from when deriving other forms, such as
diﬀerent tenses.)
If these A-stems can be termed “derived verbs”, the other category con-
sists of the “non-derived” or primary verbs. These are verbs that display
no such ending as -ya, -ta, -na or -a. The verbal stems in question can be
termed “primary” or “basic” since they essentially represent a primitive root
with no additions. For instance, the verb mat- “eat” comes directly from
the root mat- of similar meaning. Tac- “fasten” represents the root tak-
“ﬁx, make fast”. Tul- “come” can be identiﬁed with the root tul- “come,
approach, move towards” (contrast the derived verb tulta- “send for, sum-
mon, fetch” from the same root, derived by means of the ending -ta). In the
case of the roots mel- “love” and sir- “ﬂow”, Tolkien didn’t even bother to
repeat the glosses for the Quenya verbs mel- and sir- (see LR:372, 385).
When discussing Quenya verbs, we sometimes need to refer to the stem-
vowel. This is the vowel of the root-word underlying the verb as it appears
in Quenya. In the case of primary verbs like mel- “love”, it is of course
easy to identify the stem-vowel, since e is the only vowel there is (and sure
enough, this is also the vowel of the underlying root mel-). In the case of
derived verbs like pusta- “stop” or ora- “impel”, the vowels of the added
ending (here -ta and -a) do not count as stem-vowels. Pusta-, for instance,
is derived from a root pus, and its stem-vowel is therefore u, not a. In the
vast majority of cases, the stem-vowel is simply the ﬁrst vowel of the verb
(but not necessarily so, there may be some preﬁxed element).
With this we have the necessary terms in place and can ﬁnally start dis-
cussing the formation of the present tense. To start with the primary verbs,
what seems to be the present tense of the verb mel- “love” is attested in
LR:61, Elendil telling his son Herendil: Yonya iny¨
e tye-m´
ela, “I too, my
son, I love thee”. Here we have the verb describing a present or on-going (in
this case quite permanent) action. Another example of a present-tense pri-
mary verb can apparently be found in the LotR itself, in the famous greeting
elen s´
ıla l´
umenn’ omentielvo, “a star shines [or, is shining] upon the
hour of our meeting”. S´
ıla would seem to be the present tense of a verb
sil- “shine (with white or silver light)”, listed in the Silmarillion Appendix.
M´
ela and s´
ıla show the same relationship to the simple verbal stems mel-
and sil-: the present-tense forms are derived by lengthening the stem-vowel
(this is denoted by supplying an accent, of course) and adding the ending -a.
This conclusion is supported by an example from VT41:13: The verb quet-
“speak, say” there appears in the present tense qu´
eta “is saying”.
Though forms like m´
ela and s´
ıla may occasionally be translated using
the simple present tense in English, hence “love(s)” and “shines”, is seems
that the Quenya present tense properly denotes a continuous or ongoing
action that is best translated using the English “is . . .-ing” construction,
as in the example qu´
eta just quoted: this is “is saying” rather than just
94


“says”. The conclusion that the Quenya present tense properly denotes con-
tinuous actions is also supported by other evidence: The Quenya present
tense of the primary verb mat- “eat” is nowhere attested in published ma-
terial. However, Tolkien stated that mˆ
atˆ
a was “the stem of the continuous
form”, which could be translated “is eating” (VT39:9; ˆ
a here denotes long
a, in Quenya spelt ´
a). Tolkien actually put an asterisk in front of mˆ
atˆ
a to
mark it as an “unattested” form, so this should evidently be taken as prim-
itive Elvish rather than Quenya. How Quenya evolved from the primitive
language can be inferred from many other examples, so we know that mˆ
atˆ
a
would come out as m´
ata. This form would seem to fall into the same pat-
tern as m´
ela, s´
ıla and qu´
eta: lengthened stem-vowel and ending -a (and
working backwards, we can deduce that Tolkien meant m´
ela, s´
ıla, qu´
eta
to be descended from primitive Elvish mˆ
elˆ
a, sˆ
ılˆ
a, kwˆ
etˆ
a). Presumably these
are all “continuous” forms; just like primitive mˆ
atˆ
a “is eating” they appar-
ently emphasize the ongoing nature of the action: S´
ıla may literally be “is
shining” rather than just “shines”. Perhaps the lengthening of the stem-
vowel somehow symbolizes this ongoing or “drawn-out” action. In the case
of m´
ela in the sentence iny¨
e tye-m´
ela, it is more natural to translate “I
love you” rather than “I am loving you”, but the latter would seem to be
the most literal meaning.
Then we must consider the second and larger category of verbs, the A-
stems. In their case, the information from VT41 is of particular value.
It seems that the A-stems form their present tense by somewhat the same
rule as the primary verbs, but the rule needs a little “adaptation” to ﬁt the
shape of an A-stem verb. Our sole attested example is the verb ora- “urge”
or “impel”. VT41:13, 18 indicates that its present tense is ´
or¨
ea (“is urging”).
As in the case of primary verbs, the stem-vowel has been lengthened and
the ending -a has been added. There is one complication, though: since the
verbal stem ora- already ended in -a, this vowel is changed to e so as to
avoid to a’s in sequence: What would be ´
ora-a manifests as ´
or¨
ea. Hence
we must conclude that verbs like mapa- “grasp, seize” and lala- “laugh”
appear as m´
ap¨
ea, l´
al¨
ea in the present tense.
Short A-stems like ora- or mapa- are however of a rather unusual shape,
since they add only the simple vowel -a to the original root. As discussed
above, A-stems where the ﬁnal -a is only part of a longer derivational ending
(most often -ya or -ta) are much more common. We have already quoted
examples like calya- “to illuminate” and tulta- “to summon” (roots kal,
tul). Such “complex” A-stems have a consonant cluster following the vowel
of the original root, like ly and lt in these examples. We have no actual
example of the present tense of such a verb. If we were to apply the pattern
we deduce to exist from the example ´
or¨
ea “is urging”, it would land us on
forms like ?c´
aly¨
ea “is illuminating” and ?t´
ult¨
ea “is summoning”. However,
there seems to be a phonological rule in Quenya prohibiting a long vowel
immediately in front of a consonant cluster. It would seem that a word like
95


?t´
ult¨
ea cannot exist (but frankly I’m not quite sure about ?c´
aly¨
ea, since
ly/ny/ry sometimes seem to count as unitary palatalized consonants rather
than consonant clusters). Lacking actual examples, we can only assume that
in such a case the lengthening of the vowel would simply be dropped, so that
the present tense of verbs like calya- and tulta- would be caly¨
ea, tult¨
ea
(though as I just indicated, ?c´
aly¨
ea may be possible for all I know). This
would apply wherever there is a consonant cluster following the vowel of
the verbal stem. Further examples are lanta- “fall”, harna- “wound” and
pusta- “stop”, that would all – presumably – form their present-tense forms
in -¨
ea: Lant¨
ea “is falling”, harn¨
ea “is wounding”, pust¨
ea “is stopping”.
We must assume that this system also applies where there is a diphthong
in the verbal stem, since like a vowel in front of a consonant cluster, a
diphthong cannot be lengthened in any way. The present-tense forms of
verbs like faina- “emit light” or auta- “pass” would presumably be fain¨
ea,
aut¨
ea.
We now know enough to start building simple sentences:
• Isil s´
ıla “the Moon is shining” (present tense s´
ıla formed from the
primary verb sil- “shine”)
• I Elda l´
al¨
ea “the Elf is laughing” (present tense formed from the
short A-stem lala- “laugh”)
• Lass¨
e lant¨
ea “a leaf is falling” (present tense formed from the com-
plex A-stem lanta- “fall”; we cannot have *l´
ant¨
ea paralleling l´
al¨
ea
because a long vowel cannot occur in front of a consonant cluster)
Some useful terms can be included here. Once you include a verb in the
sentence, denoting some kind of action, you must normally devote another
part of the sentence to telling who is doing this action. The party that
does whatever the verb tells us is being done, constitutes the subject of the
sentence. In a sentence like Isil s´
ıla “the Moon is shining”, it is thus Isil
“the Moon” that is the subject, since it is the Moon that does the shining
the verb s´
ıla tells us about. In a sentence like i Elda m´
ata “the Elf is
eating”, i Elda “the Elf” is the subject, since the Elf does the eating.
This very sentence, i Elda m´
ata, has possibilities. We can add one more
element, like the noun massa “bread”, and get i Elda m´
ata massa “the
Elf is eating bread”. Now what is the function of this added word? It is
the “target” of the verbal action, in this case what is eaten. The target of
the verbal action is called the object, the passive counterpart of the active
subject: The subject does something, but the object is what the subject does
something to. The subject “subjects” the object to some kind of action. This
“action” may of course be much less dramatic than “subject eats object” as
in the example above. For instance, it can be as subtle as in the sentence
“the subject sees the object” (ﬁll in with other sense-verbs if you like),
where the “action” of the subject does not physically aﬀect the object in
96


any way. That is not the point here. The basic idea of the subject-object
dichotomy is simply that the subject does something to the object, though
“does something to” must sometimes be understood in a wider sense.
NOTE: Notice, though, that in sentences with the copula n´
a/nar “is/are”, for instance
i alda n´
a tasar “the tree is a willow”, tasar “a willow” does not count as the object
of i alda “the tree”. I alda is the subject all right, since this is the element that “does”
what little action there is in this sentence: “the tree is. . . ” But tasar “a willow” is not
the object, for in this sentence “the tree” does not do anything to “a willow” – and the
hallmark of the object is that something is done to it. Rather than doing anything do
a willow, the tree is a willow, and that is another thing altogether: Tasar is here the
predicate of i alda, as we discussed in the previous lesson. But if we substitute m´
ata
“is eating” for n´
a “is”, we are right back to a subject-verb-object construction: I alda
m´
ata tasar, “the tree is eating a willow”. If you are unduly troubled by the fact that
this sounds somewhat nonsensical, rest assured that the grammar is ﬁne.
In the case of some verbs, there can be no object. In the case of (say)
lanta- “to fall”, you can have a subject and say i Elda lant¨
ea “the Elf
is falling”. Here the subject doesn’t do anything to an object; it is just the
subject itself that is doing something. With a verb like mat- “eat”, it is
kind of optional if you want to ﬁll out the sentence with an object or not: I
Elda m´
ata (massa), “the Elf is eating (bread)”; this works as a complete
sentence even without the object. But some verbs by their meaning demand
an object, and the sentence would be felt to be incomplete without it. If we
say i Elda m´
ap¨
ea “the Elf is seizing”, this only raises the question “the Elf
is seizing what?” and we must come up with an object to make the sentence
complete.
In the Plotz letter, Tolkien indicated that in one variant of Quenya, so-
called Book Quenya, nouns would have a special form if they function as
objects. Singular nouns ending in a vowel would have this vowel lengthened
(for instance, cirya “ship” would become ciry´
a if it appears as the object
of a sentence), and nouns that normally employ the plural ending -r would
switch to -i (so “ships”, as object, would be ciryai instead of ciryar). This
special “object” form, in linguistic terms the accusative case, was suppos-
edly used in (archaic?) written Quenya. However, this accusative does not
appear in any actual texts, such as Nam´
ari¨
e or even the last version of the
Markirya poem, which must be almost contemporaneous with the Plotz let-
ter. Nam´
ari¨
e, sung by Galadriel, is perhaps supposed to reﬂect the usage of
spoken Third Age Quenya. Whatever the case, I do not use the distinct ac-
cusative in the exercises I have made for this course (or in my own Quenya
compositions). It seems clear that the use of the accusative was far from
universal, within or without the ﬁctional context. So I would say cirya(r)
for “ship(s)” even if the word appears as the object of a sentence.
With the terms subject and object in place, we can discuss another feature
of the Quenya verb. Just like adjectives agree in number with the nouns they
describe, verbs agree in number with their subjects. Let us have a closer look
97


at the ﬁrst line of Nam´
ari¨
e, lauri¨
e lantar lassi “like gold fall the leaves”,
or literally “golden fall [the] leaves”. Here the adjective laur¨
ea “golden”
appears in plural form lauri¨
e to agree in number with the plural noun lassi
“leaves”, as we discussed in the previous lesson. But the verb lanta- “to
fall” must also agree with its plural subject lassi. The verb lanta therefore
takes the ending -r. (The verb itself appears in the so-called aorist tense, to
be discussed later; you can think of aorist lantar vs. present tense lant¨
ear
as corresponding to English “fall” vs. “are falling”, respectively.) The plural
ending -r we have already met in the case of nouns, as in Eldar “Elves”,
but nouns may also have plurals in -i, depending on their shape. In the case
of verbs, the plural ending -r seems to be universal, no matter what the verb
looks like. The ending -r is not restricted to the present tense of verbs, but
is seemingly used in all tenses, wherever a plural subject turns up.
Essentially we have already met the verbal plural ending in the verb nar
“are”, the plural of n´
a “is”. (One may ask why n´
a does not turn into ?n´
ar
with the long vowel intact. The latter form may very well turn out to be
valid, but nar “are” with a short a is at least less prone to confusion with
the noun n´
ar “ﬂame”.)
More than one subject has the same eﬀect on the verb as a (single) plural
subject, the verb taking the ending -r in both instances:
I arani m´
atar “the kings are eating” (sg. i aran m´
ata “the king is
eating”)
I aran ar i t´
ari m´
atar “the king and the queen are eating” (if you want
the verb mat- “eat” to appear in singular present-tense form m´
ata here,
you must get rid of either the king or the queen so that there is just a single
subject)
On the other hand, it has no eﬀect on the verb if we have a plural object
or multiple objects, e.g. i aran m´
ata massa ar apsa “the king is eating
bread and meat” (apsa “cooked food, meat”). The verb agrees in number
with the subject only.
It has generally been assumed that the verb has only one plural form, the
ending -r being universal. In other words, the verb would take the ending -r
not only where the subject noun appears in the “normal” plural (ending -r
or -i), but also where it is dual (ending -u or -t) or appears in the “partitive
plural” form (ending -li). However, we have no actual examples from LotR-
style Quenya, and in particular I will not rule out the possibility that there
may be a special dual form of the verb to go with dual subjects (ending -t
as for most nouns, like Aldu s´
ılat rather than Aldu s´
ılar for “the Two
Trees are shining”???) The published material allows no certain conclusion
in this question, so I will simply avoid dual subjects in the exercises I make
for this course.
The last thing we must consider when discussing the verb is the question
of word order. Where in the sentence does the verb ﬁt in, really? English
98


sentences generally list the subject, the verb and the object (if there is any
object) in that order. The attentive reader will have noticed that most of the
Quenya sentences above are organized in the same manner. This seems to be
the most typical word order in Quenya prose. Examples of the subject and
the verb in that order include lassi lantar “leaves fall” and morni¨
e caita
“darkness lies [upon the foaming waves]” – both from the prose version
of Nam´
ari¨
e. But there are also examples of the verb being placed ﬁrst,
e.g. Fingon’s cry before the Nirnaeth Arnoediad: Auta i l´
om¨
e!, literally
“Passes the night”, but translated “the night is passing!” in the Silmarillion
ch. 20. Indeed both of the above-quoted examples of the order subject-verb
from the prose Nam´
ari¨
e instead show the order verb-subject in the poetic
version in LotR: lantar lassi, caita morni¨
e. In English, fronting the verb
is one way of turning a declarative statement into a question, e.g. “Elves
are beautiful” vs. “are Elves beautiful?”, but this way of forming questions
evidently doesn’t work in Quenya. (Auta i l´
om¨
e! “passes the night!” for
“the night is passing!” is perhaps an example of dramatic style or aﬀectionate
speech; the verbal action is evidently considered more important than the
subject that performs it. I suspect that in a less dramatic context, one would
rather say i l´
om¨
e auta.)
Nam´
ari¨
e also provides an example of a sentence with both subject, verb
and object: h´
ısi¨
e unt´
upa Calaciryo m´
ıri, “mist [subject] covers [verb] the
jewels of Calacirya [this whole phrase being the object]”. Yet word order is
again quite ﬂexible, especially in poetry, as further examples from Nam´
ari¨
e
shows. We have object-subject-verb in the sentence m´
aryat Elent´
ari or-
tan¨
e, literally “her hands (the) Starqueen raised” (in LotR translated “the
Queen of the stars . . . has uplifted her hands”). The sentence ily¨
e tier
undul´
av¨
e lumbul¨
e, literally “all paths downlicked (i.e. covered) shadow”,
has the order object-verb-subject (in LotR, Tolkien used the translation
“all paths are drowned deep in shadow”). In the prose version of Nam´
ari¨
e,
Tolkien interestingly reorganized both of these to subject-verb-object con-
structions: Elent´
ari ortan¨
e m´
aryat, lumbul¨
e undul´
av¨
e ily¨
e tier. This
is our main basis for assuming that this is the normal order, preferred where
there are no poetic or dramatic considerations to be made.
In general, one must be careful about putting the object before the sub-
ject, for this could in some cases cause confusion as to which word is the
object and which is the subject (since the commonest form of Quenya does
not maintain a distinct accusative case to mark the object). Such inversions
are however quite permissible when the subject is singular and the object
is plural or vice versa. Then the verb, agreeing in number with the subject
only, will indirectly identify it. In the sentence ily¨
e tier undul´
av¨
e lum-
bul¨
e we can readily tell that it must be lumbul¨
e “shadow” and not ily¨
e
tier “all paths” that is the subject, because the verb undul´
av¨
e does not
receive the ending -r to agree with the plural word tier. Hence this can’t be
the subject – but the singular noun lumbul¨
e “shadow” can.

5.2
More about adjectives
In English and other European languages, adjectives have special forms that
are used in comparison. In English, adjectives have a comparative form that
is constructed by adding the ending -er, and a superlative form that is formed
with the ending -est. For instance, the adjective tall has the comparative
form taller and the superlative form tallest. (In the case of some adjectives,
English however resorts to the independent words more and most instead
of using the endings, e.g. more intelligent and most intelligent instead of
intelligenter and intelligentest, which forms are perceived as cumbersome.)
The function of these forms is to facilitate comparison between various par-
ties. If we want to say that one party possesses the quality described by
the adjective to a greater extent than some other party, we may use the
comparative form: “Peter is taller than Paul.” The superlative form is used
if we want to say that one party possesses the quality in question more than
all others that are considered: “Peter is the tallest boy in the class.”
In the ﬁrst version of this Quenya lesson, as published in December 2000,
I wrote: “But when it comes to Quenya, there is not much we can say. The
published material includes absolutely no information about comparative
forms; we don’t even have an independent word for ‘more’. . . ” Since then,
the situation has happily changed; during 2001 a little more information
appeared in the journals Tyali¨
e Tyelelli´
eva and Vinyar Tengwar. Now we
do have a word for “more” (malda), and we also know a special formula
that is used in comparison: “A is brighter than B” may be expressed as “A
n´
a calima l´
a B”, literally “A is bright beyond B” (VT42:32). However, the
word l´
a has other meanings beside “beyond”, and it will be more practical
to discuss and practice its use in comparison in a later lesson (“The various
uses of l´
a”, Lesson Eighteen).
We will here focus on the superlative form of adjectives instead. One
tiny scrap of evidence has long been available: In Letters:278–279, Tolkien
explained the adjectival form ancalima occurring in LotR. Translating it as
“exceedingly bright”, he stated that this is calima “shining brilliant” with
the element an- added, the latter being a “superlative or intensive preﬁx”.
For this reason, many writers have used the preﬁx an- as the equivalent
of the English ending -est, to construct the superlative form of adjectives
– e.g. anvanya “fairest” from vanya “fair, beautiful” (but is should be
understood that ancalima remains our sole attested example of an- used
in this sense).
One may wonder whether the form that is made by preﬁxing an- re-
ally is the equivalent of an English superlative, sc. a form of the adjective
that implies having the most of the property involved in comparison with
certain others. It may be noted that Tolkien translated ancalima, not as
“brightest”, but as “exceedingly bright”. When he describes an- as a “su-
perlative or intensive preﬁx”, he may almost seem to mean ‘superlative or
100


rather intensive preﬁx’. So perhaps an- implies “very, exceedingly” rather
than “most” in comparison with others. It may be noted, though, that the
context the in which the word is found does seem to imply a certain amount
of “comparison”: In LotR, ancalima occurs as part of Frodo’s “speaking in
tongues” in Shelob’s lair (volume 2, Book Four, chapter IX): Aiya E¨
arendil
Elenion Ancalima. No translation is given in the LotR itself, but Tolkien
later stated that this means “hail E¨
arendil brightest of stars” (Letters:385).
In Tolkien’s mythology, E¨
arendil carrying the shining Silmaril was set in the
heavens as the brightest of the stars. So here, the meaning does seem to
be that of a genuine superlative, “brightest” in the full sense of “brighter
than all the others”. In any case, no other information on how to form the
superlative appears in published writings, so we have little choice but to
use this formation. We must however be prepared that future publications
may provide more information about this, involving alternative superlative
formations.
The preﬁx an- in this form cannot be mechanically preﬁxed to any Quenya
adjective, or consonant clusters that Quenya does not allow would sometimes
result. An- can be preﬁxed “as is” to adjectives beginning in a vowel or in
c-, n-, qu-, t-, v-, w-, and y-:
an + alta “great (in size)” = analta “greatest”
an + calima “bright” = ancalima “brightest” (our sole attested exam-
ple!)
an + norna “tough” = annorna “toughest”
an + quanta “full” = anquanta “fullest”
an + vanya “beautiful” = anvanya “most beautiful”
an + wenya “green” = anwenya “greenest”
an + y´
ara “old” = any´
ara “oldest”
Perhaps we can also include adjectives in f- and h- (no examples):
an + f´
ana “white” = ?anf´
ana “whitest”
an + halla “tall” = ?anhalla “tallest”
What would happen in other cases we cannot say for certain. Either an
extra vowel (likely e or a) would be inserted between the preﬁx and the
adjective to break up what would otherwise be an impossible cluster, or
the ﬁnal -n of the preﬁx would change, becoming more similar (or wholly
similar) to the ﬁrst consonant of the adjective. Such assimilation is observed
elsewhere in our corpus, so this has to be our favourite theory regarding
the behavior of an- as well. Before the consonant p-, the n of an would
likely be pronounced with the lips closed because the pronunciation of p
involves such a closure; hence n would turn into m. (Compare English input
often being pronounced imput.) From pitya “small” we would thus have
ampitya for “smallest”, this being the impossible word anpitya reworked
101


into a permissible form (Quenya does not have np, but the cluster mp is
frequent even in unitary words).
Before the consonants l-, r-, s-, and m-, the ﬁnal n of an- would probably
be fully assimilated, that is, it becomes identical to the following consonant:
an + lauca “warm” = allauca “warmest”
an + ringa “cold” = arringa “coldest”
an + sarda “hard” = assarda “hardest”
an + moina “dear” = ammoina “dearest”
Cf. such attested assimilations as nl becoming ll in the compound N´
umel-
l´
ot¨
e “Flower of the West” (UT:227, transparently a compound of the well-
known words n´
umen “west” and l´
ot¨
e “ﬂower”). As for the group nm be-
coming mm, this development is seen in the name of the Vanyarin Elf El-
emm´
ır¨
e mentioned in the Silmarillion: his (her?) name apparently means
“Star-jewel” (elen “star” + m´
ır¨
e “jewel”).
Summary of Lesson Five
Two major categories of Quenya verbs are the primary verbs, that repre-
sent a primitive root with no additions, and the A-stems, that have added
an ending including the vowel a to the original root (sometimes -a alone,
but more commonly some longer ending like -ya or -ta). The primary verbs
form their present tense by lengthening the stem-vowel and adding -a, e.g.
s´
ıla “is shining” from sil- “to shine”. The A-stems form their present tense
by somewhat the same rule, but when the ending -a is added to such a
stem (already ending in -a), what would be -aa is changed to -¨
ea. In our
one attested example of the present tense of an A-stem, ´
or¨
ea from ora- “to
impel”, the stem-vowel has been lengthened. However, as far as we under-
stand Quenya phonology, a long vowel cannot normally occur in front of a
consonant cluster, and most A-stems do have a consonant cluster following
the stem-vowel (e.g. lanta- “to fall”, hilya- “to follow”). Presumably such
verbs would form their present tense in -¨
ea, but the stem-vowel would re-
main short. Only the (relatively few) A-stems that do not have a consonant
cluster following the stem-vowel can lengthen it in the present tense. – A
verb agrees with its subject in number, receiving the ending -r if the subject
is plural: elen s´
ıla “a star is shining”, eleni s´
ılar “stars are shining”.
A superlative form of adjectives can be derived by adding the preﬁx an-, as
in ancalima “brightest” from calima “bright”. We must, however, assume
that the n of this preﬁx is in many cases assimilated to the ﬁrst consonant of
the adjective, or consonant clusters that Quenya phonology does not allow
would arise. For instance, an- + lauca “warm” may produce allauca for
“warmest” (*anlauca being an impossible word).

Lesson 6
Past tense
6.1
The past tense
The previous lesson discussed the Quenya present tense, which is typically
used to describe an on-going present action. However, Quenya has diﬀer-
ent tenses covering the entire trinity of past, present and future, and when
recounting past events one will normally use the past tense.
In English, very many past tenses are formed by means of the ending -ed,
e.g. ﬁlled as the past tense of the verb ﬁll. In Quenya, most past tense forms
are likewise formed by means of an ending added to the verbal stem. As far
as we know, all past tense verbs end in the vowel -¨
e (though further endings,
such as the plural ending -r that is used in the case of a plural subject, may
of course be added after this vowel). In many cases, this vowel -¨
e is part
of the ending -n¨
e, that seems to be the most general past tense ending in
Quenya.
As discussed in the previous lesson, most Quenya verbs are A-stems, mean-
ing that they end in the vowel -a. The past tenses of these verbs are typically
formed simply by adding the ending -n¨
e. For instance, the Etymologies men-
tion a verb orta- “raise” (see the entry oro), and in Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR its
past tense is seen to be ortan¨
e. (The simplest translation of ortan¨
e is of
course “raised”; the somewhat free rendering in LotR employs the transla-
tion “has uplifted” instead, but Tolkien’s interlinear translation in RGEO:67
reads “lifted up” – which is merely an alternative wording of “raised”.) Other
examples from Tolkien’s notes:
ora- “urge”, past tense oran¨
e “urged” (VT41:13, 18)
hehta- “exclude”, past tense hehtan¨
e “excluded” (WJ:365)
ulya- “pour”, past tense ulyan¨
e “poured” (Etym, entry ulu)
sinta- “fade”, past tense sintan¨
e “faded” (Etym, entry thin)
We may add the verb ahyan¨
e “changed” (or “did change”), only attested
like this in the past tense, as part of the question manen lamb¨
e Quendion
ahyan¨
e[?] “how did the language of the Elves change?” (PM:395). The verb
105


“change” would seem to be ahya-.
Regarding the verb ava- (apparently meaning “refuse, forbid”), Tolkien
noted that its past tense avan¨
e “revealed that it was not in origin a ‘strong’
or basic verbal stem”. The latter seems to be more or less the same as a
primary verb. He called avan¨
e a “weak” past tense form (WJ:370). That
probably goes for all the past tenses so far discussed. (What Tolkien would
call a “strong” past tense is not quite clear. Perhaps he would use this term
of the past tenses formed by means of nasal-inﬁxion – see below.)
We must also consider the “basic” or “primary”, ending-less verbs, verbs
that unlike the A-stems do not have a ﬁnal vowel: verbs like sil- “to shine”,
tir- “to watch”, mat- “to eat”.
It seems that the ending -n¨
e can be used to form the past tense of some
primary verbs as well. Tolkien mentioned tirn¨
e as the past tense of the verb
tir- “to watch” (Etym, entry tir), and he also quoted tamn¨
e as the past
tense of the verb tam- “to tap” (Etym, entry tam). In these cases, adding
-n¨
e to the verbal stems in question does not produce impossible consonant
clusters: Both rn and mn are permitted by Quenya phonology. For this
reason, the ending -n¨
e can probably also be added to verbal stems ending in
-n, since double nn is likewise a wholly acceptable combination in Quenya.
For instance, the past tense of the verb cen- “to see” is presumably cenn¨
e
“saw”, though we have no attested example of the past tense of a verb of
this shape.
But whenever the stem of a basic verb ends in any consonant other than
just -m, -n, or -r, simply adding the ending -n¨
e would produce consonant
clusters that Quenya cannot have. The past tense forms of verbs like mat-
“eat”, top- “cover” or tac- “fasten” cannot be **matn¨
e, **topn¨
e, **tacn¨
e,
for clusters like tn, pn, cn are not found in the language. So what happens?
The diﬃcult way of describing what occurs is to say that the n of the
ending -n¨
e is replaced by nasal-inﬁxion intruding before the last consonant
of the verbal stem. What is “inﬁxion”? We have already mentioned suﬃxes,
elements added at the end of a word (like the plural ending -r, added to the
noun Elda in its plural form Eldar), and preﬁxes, elements added at the
beginning of a word (like the superlative preﬁx an-, added to the adjective
calima “bright” in its superlative form ancalima “brightest”). If you want
to add something to a word, there are only so many places you can ﬁt it in;
if it is not to be preﬁxed or suﬃxed, the ﬁnal option is to inﬁx it, that is, jam
it into the word. For instance, the verb mat- “to eat” has the past tense
mant¨
e “ate” (VT39:7), an inﬁxed n turning up before the ﬁnal consonant of
the verbal stem (t becoming nt). Similarly, the verb hat- “break asunder”
has the past tense hant¨
e (Etym, entry skat).
Before the consonant p, the inﬁx takes the form m rather than n, so that
the past tense of top- “to cover” is tomp¨
e (Etym, entry top). Before c, the
inﬁx appears as n (or actually ˜
n, see below), so that the past tense of tac-
“to fasten” is tanc¨
e (Etym, entry tak). The various forms of the inﬁx – n,
106


m or ˜
n, depending on the environment – are all nasals, sounds pronounced
by making the stream of air from the lungs go out through the nose rather
than the mouth. Hence nasal-inﬁxion is a ﬁtting term for this phonological
process.
As I said, that was the diﬃcult way of stating what happens. Put more
simply: if adding the past tense ending -n¨
e to a primary verb would result
in any of the impossible clusters tn, cn, pn, the n and the consonant before
it switch places. Tn and cn simply become nt and nc; what would be np
changes to mp to ease pronunciation. (Actually what would be nc similarly
changes to ˜
nc, using ˜
n for ng as in king as Tolkien sometimes did – but ac-
cording to the spelling conventions here employed, ˜
nc is represented simply
as nc.) Hence:
mat- “eat”, past tense (**matn¨
e >) mant¨
e “ate”
top- “cover”, past tense (**topn¨
e > **tonp¨
e >) tomp¨
e “covered”
tac- “fasten”, past tense (**tacn¨
e >) tanc¨
e “fastened”
This, at least, is an easy way to imagine it for pedagogical purposes.
We cannot know for certain whether Tolkien imagined this to be the ac-
tual development – a form something like matn¨
e actually occurring at an
earlier stage, but later becoming mant¨
e by swapping around the conso-
nants t and n. The linguistic term for such transposing of two sounds is
metathesis, and there are other examples of metathesized consonants in the
imaginary evolution of Tolkien’s languages (see for instance the Etymolo-
gies, entry kel-). However, some clues suggest that Tolkien imagined these
past tenses to reﬂect “genuine” nasal-inﬁxion occurring already in primitive
Elvish, not merely a later transposition of consonants. After all, he had one
of his characters observe that “nasal-inﬁxion is of considerable importance
in Avallonian” (SD:433; Avallonian is another term for Quenya). But this is
an academic question.
Primary verbs with -l as their ﬁnal consonant must be given special at-
tention. The verb vil- “to ﬂy” is said to have the past tense vill¨
e (Etym,
entry wil). This double ll probably represents some combination of l and n.
Perhaps vill¨
e is meant to represent older wiln¨
e with the normal past tense
ending (notice that in this case, v comes from older w: root wil), the group
ln turning into ll in Quenya. However, other examples suggest that older
ln would rather produce Quenya ld. It may well be that vill¨
e is meant to
represent older winl¨
e, that is, a nasal-inﬁxed variant of the verb wil- (since
nl also became ll in Quenya; for instance, the noun nell¨
e “brook” is said to
come from older nen-le: Etym, entry nen). Whatever development Tolkien
may have imagined, primary verbs with l as their ﬁnal consonant seem to
form their past tense form by adding -l¨
e.
NOTE: In Telerin, the sister language of Quenya in the Blessed Realm, a verb formed
from a root del (“go”) is said to have the past tense delle: WJ:364. As pointed out by Ales
Bican, this form probably descends from older denle (with nasal-inﬁxion). If it descended
107


from delne, it would likely have remained unchanged in Telerin, since the cluster ln is
permitted in this language (cf. a Telerin word like elni “stars”, WJ:362). This observation
supports the view that past tenses with nasal-inﬁxion did occur already in Primitive
Elvish.
The system set out above is what I shall consider the “regular” way of
forming the past tense of a verb in Quenya. That is, as long as a verb
conforms with this system, I will not explicitly list its past tense when I
ﬁrst mention it. All the past tenses in the exercises below are constructed
according to this system, so your task this time is to internalize the rules
above. Some irregular forms will be discussed in later lessons, but even so,
we will here survey certain “alternative” past tense formations (contrasting
them with the more regular forms may actually be helpful in memorizing the
normal system – but the student is not expected to memorize this survey as
such). So do skim through as much as you can take of the stuﬀbelow, and
proceed to the exercises when you’ve had enough.
The past tense of primary verbs with -r as their ﬁnal consonant is rela-
tively well-attested: Attested examples include car- “make, do”, pa.t. carn¨
e
(Etym, entry kar), tir- “watch”, pa.t. tirn¨
e (Etym, entry tir) and tur-
“govern”, pa.t. turn¨
e (Etym, entry tur). So above we set out the rule that
verbs of this shape have past tense forms that are constructed by adding the
suﬃx -n¨
e. But a few verbs behave quite diﬀerently. The past tense of the
verb rer- “sow” is not **rern¨
e as we might expect, but rend¨
e: See Etym,
entry red. The reason for this is precisely the fact that the original root-
word was red rather than **rer. Thus the verb rer- appeared as red- at
an earlier stage, and then the past tense rend¨
e is actually “regular” enough:
it is simply formed from red- by means of nasal-inﬁxion + the ending -¨
e
(just like such a regular verb as quet- “say” has the pa.t. quent¨
e). What
slightly complicates matters is that in Quenya, original d only survived as
part of the clusters ld, nd, and rd; in all other positions it was changed, and
following a vowel it normally became r. Hence red- turned into rer-, while
the past tense rend¨
e remained unscathed by the phonological changes. In
this perspective, the verb is strictly speaking not “irregular” at all; it just
behaves diﬀerently because it has a special history – and this goes for very
many of the “irregularities” in Quenya: As observed by his son, Tolkien’s lin-
guistic creations “imagine language not as ‘pure structure’, without ‘before’
or ‘after’, but as growth, in time” (LR:342). Tolkien clearly liked leaving in
various testimonials to this imaginary age-long “growth”.
We don’t know very many verbs in -r that should have past tenses in -nd¨
e
because of their special history. From the Etymologies we must presumably
include the verbs hyar- “cleave” and ser- “rest” (since these come from
roots syad and sed, see the relevant entries in Etym – but Tolkien did not
actually mention the past tense forms hyand¨
e and send¨
e). In a post-LotR
source we have a verb nir- “press, thrust, force”; again no past tense form
has been published, but since the stem is given as nid it should presumably
108


be nind¨
e rather than nirn¨
e (VT41:17). More attested examples could be
quoted from early “Qenya” material, but these writings do not have full au-
thority as regards LotR-style Quenya. For instance, the 1915 Qenya Lexicon
seems to include the verb nyar- “tell, relate” in this category (past tense
nyand¨
e, QL:68). But in later material, Tolkien derived this verb from a root
nar (entry nar2 in Etym) rather than nad, so now its past tense would
presumably be regular (nyarn¨
e).
Some primary verbs are also seen to use a past tense formation that dis-
penses with any nasal sounds. The verb does receive the ending -¨
e, the vowel
displayed by all past-tense forms, but instead of adding a nasal sound (in-
ﬁxed or as part of the ending -n¨
e), the stem-vowel of the verb is lengthened.
For instance, the past tense of the verb lav- “lick” is seen to be l´
av¨
e (at-
tested in Nam´
ari¨
e as part of the verb undul´
av¨
e “down-licked”, that is,
“covered”). Likewise, the past tense of the negative verb um- “not do” or
“not be” is said to be ´
um¨
e (Etym, entry ugu/umu; we will return to this
peculiar verb in Lesson Nine). This past tense formation is quite common
in the early Qenya Lexicon, and it also turns up in relatively late (but still
pre-LotR) sources. F´
ıriel’s Song of ca. 1936 agrees with the 1915 Lexicon
that the past tense of the verb car- “make, do” is c´
ar¨
e (QL:45, LR:72; the
spelling used in the sources is k´
are). However, according to the Etymologies
(entry kar), the past tense is carn¨
e – and that is the form we will use here:
The Etymologies is, at least in part, slightly younger than Firiel’s Song.
Following the pattern of c´
ar¨
e, some pre-LotR sources give t´
ul¨
e as the past
tense of the verb tul- “come” (LR:47, SD:246), but vill¨
e as the past tense
of vil- in the Etymologies suggests that the past tense “came” could just as
well be tull¨
e (representing older tulne or tunle) instead.
It might seem that Tolkien eventually decided to limit the use of the past
tense formation represented by t´
ul¨
e and c´
ar¨
e, though it was never wholly
abandoned, as the form undul´
av¨
e in Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR demonstrates. We
might actually have expected the past tense of lav- “lick” to be **lamb¨
e
rather than l´
av¨
e. A past tense form lamb¨
e would be constructed by nasal-
inﬁxion of the original root-word lab (itself listed in Etym): In Quenya,
original b normally became v following a vowel, but b persisted unchanged
in the group mb. The Qenya Lexicon actually lists amb¨
e as the past tense of
a verb av- “depart” (QL:33); this may be an example of this phenomenon.
However, **lamb¨
e as the past tense of lav- would clash with the noun
lamb¨
e “tongue, language”; perhaps this is why Tolkien decided to go for
the irregular formation l´
av¨
e instead. Or should we generalize from lav- and
let all Quenya primary verbs in -v form their past tense after the pattern
of l´
av¨
e?
Luckily, these verbs are not very numerous. There is a distinct verb lav-
meaning “yield, allow, grant” (root dab, see Etym), possibly a verb tuv-
“ﬁnd” (verbal stem isolated from a longer form), plus tyav- as the verb
“taste” (see entry kyab in Etym). Should the past tense “tasted” be tyamb¨
e
109


or ty´
av¨
e? The latter past tense form is actually attested in the Qenya
Lexicon (p. 49), but since the QL is seen to use this formation quite liberally
compared to later Quenya, we cannot be sure that the information is valid
for the later stages of Tolkien’s conception. (Ty´
av¨
e is attested in a post-
LotR source as a noun “taste”; whether this argues against the same form
being used as a past tense “tasted” is unclear. In the 1915 Lexicon, Tolkien
did have similar-sounding nouns and verbal tenses coexisting; see QL:49,
entry kumu.)
There are some curious cases where even longer, derived verbs (A-stems)
drop their ending and have l´
av¨
e-style past tenses derived directly from the
ending-less root. One early example is the verb serta- “tie”, past tense s´
er¨
e
(QL:83) rather than **sertan¨
e as we might expect. These formations are far
from uncommon in the 1915 Lexicon, but the idea was not wholly obsolete
in later Quenya either: The Etymologies of the mid-thirties records that the
verb onta- “beget, create” has two possible past tenses: beside the regular
form ontan¨
e we also have the irregular form ´
on¨
e (Etym, entry ono).
The simplest A-stems, those that add the short ending -a to the root
(and not a longer ending like -ta or -ya), may also drop this ending in
some past tense formations. Above we quoted the QL form ty´
av¨
e as an
attested past tense of the verb tyav- “taste”, but in the 1915 Lexicon, the
verb “taste” is actually given as an A-stem tyava-: It is not a primary
verb tyav- as it becomes in later sources (QL:49 vs. Etym, entry kyab).
Within the later system, we would expect an A-stem tyava- to have the
past tense tyavan¨
e, but the validity of either form in LotR-style Quenya is
highly questionable. More commonly, the simplest A-stem verbs have past
tenses that are “regular” enough – if you pretend that the ﬁnal -a does not
exist! Above we quoted oran¨
e as an example of the regular past tense of
a simple A-stem verb (ora- “urge”), but immediately after writing oran¨
e,
Tolkien actually added orn¨
e as a parenthetic alternative (VT41:13). Of
course, orn¨
e would be a perfectly regular form if it were the past tense of a
primary verb **or- (cf. for instance tur- “govern”, pa.t. turn¨
e). In eﬀect,
ora- may behave as a primary verb in the past tense, discarding its ending
and jumping over into another class. The earliest material has examples
of the same phenomenon: In the QL, the past tense forms of the verbs
papa- “tremble” and pata- “rap, tap” are given as pamp¨
e, pant¨
e (p. 72),
not **papan¨
e, **patan¨
e as we would expect according to the “regular”
system. The nasal-inﬁxed past tense forms would be perfectly “regular” if
we assume that in the past tense, the simple A-stem verbs papa- and pata-
are masquerading as primary verbs **pap-, **pat-. Thus we cannot be
certain whether the past tense of the verb mapa- “grasp, seize” should be
mapan¨
e or mamp¨
e; writers have used both. Since Tolkien seems to imply
that the past tense of ora- can be both oran¨
e and orn¨
e, perhaps both are
permissible.
NOTE: In QL:59, Tolkien actually listed the past tense of mapa- as namp¨
e (sic!) In
110


the 1915 scenario, there were two variant roots, mapa and napa, that shared the past
tense namp¨
e. Do we dare to assume that this idea was still valid decades later? The verb
mapa- is listed in the Etymologies, but if Tolkien had still imagined its past tense to be
as irregular as namp¨
e, I tend to think that it would have been explicitly mentioned in
Etym as well. Furthermore, in Etym there is no trace of the alternative root napa; we
only ﬁnd map (LR:371) corresponding to mapa in the QL. But on the other hand, the
form namp¨
e is attested, so if you like it better than the unattested forms mapan¨
e or
mamp¨
e, feel free to use it.
The verb lala- “laugh” is another example of one of the simplest A-stems.
It may have the past tense lalan¨
e, but it is also possible that it should behave
as a primary verb in the past tense. But if so, we must take into account
the fact that lala- is to be derived from older g-lada- (PM:359); this is one
of the cases where an original d following a vowel turned into l rather than
r (inﬂuenced by the l earlier in the word). So if lala- has a “short” past
tense, it should probably not be lall¨
e, but rather land¨
e – derived from
a nasal-inﬁxed form of the original word g-lada-. On the other hand, the
similar but distinct verb lala- “deny” found in the Etymologies (LR:367)
never contained a d, so its past tense may well be lall¨
e (unless it is lalan¨
e,
and I think I lean toward that form).
The Etymologies actually provides a few examples of even more complex
A-stems that also drop their ending and in eﬀect transform themselves into
primary verbs in the past tense. The verb farya- “to suﬃce” is said to have
the past tense farn¨
e (Etym, entry phar); here the whole ending -ya drops
out in the past tense, which is formed as if this were a primary verb **fer-
. Based on such a regular example as the one we quoted above – namely
ulya- “pour”, past tense ulyan¨
e – we would of course expect the past tense
of ferya- to be **feryan¨
e. But actually even our “regular” example ulya-
also has an alternative past tense form ull¨
e (Etym, entry ulu), and this
is a particularly interesting example, for Tolkien indicated that the two
past tenses ulyan¨
e and ull¨
e were not interchangeable. They had somewhat
diﬀerent meanings. There will be a fuller discussion of this in Lesson Ten;
for now it suﬃces to say that I think most verbs in -ya would retain this
ending when the past tense suﬃx -n¨
e is added. (But ull¨
e as one past tense
of ulya-, formed directly from ul- rather than the full form of the verb,
would seem to conﬁrm that primary verbs in -l normally have past tenses in
-l¨
e. Except for ull¨
e, we only have the example vil- “ﬂy”, pa.t. vill¨
e to go
on – so an extra, if indirect, conﬁrmation of this pattern is very welcome!)
Finally we will discuss a strange past tense formation that may occur in
the case of verbs in -ta. Perhaps it should not be seen as irregular, for Tolkien
actually described one such past tense as “regular . . . for a -ta verb of this
class” (WJ:366). Nonetheless, its formation is less than straightforward. It
is exempliﬁed already in the earliest material: The 1915 Lexicon contains a
verb lahta- (QL:50; the verb is not clearly glossed), but its past tense is not
**lahtan¨
e as we might expect: Instead we ﬁnd lahant¨
e. In other words, the
111


verb lahta- is reworked into lahat- (the stem-vowel being repeated between
the second and the third consonant, breaking up the consonant cluster,
whereas the ﬁnal -a is dropped), and the past tense lahant¨
e is then formed
from this lahat- by means of nasal-inﬁxion and an added -¨
e, in itself a quite
regular process familiar from primary verbs.
A much later example can be found in the Etymologies, where the verb
orta- “rise, raise” is assigned a past tense form oront¨
e (Etym, entry oro),
though oront¨
e is not there clearly presented as a Quenya form: In Etym, it
is actually quite unclear what language it is meant to belong to. However,
in some of Tolkien’s earlier drafts for Nam´
ari¨
e, the past tense of orta- did
appear as oront¨
e, not “regular” ortan¨
e as it became in the ﬁnal version.
So what is going on here?
Our only real clue is what Tolkien wrote in WJ:366, where he somewhat
surprisingly declared the form oant¨
e – the past tense of auta- “go away,
leave” – to be quite regular “for a -ta verb of this class”. According to the
“regular” system we have tried to make out, oant¨
e instead of **autan¨
e in-
evitably seems highly irregular. Tolkien derived the verb auta- from a root
awa (WJ:365), so its form in the primitive language is probably meant to be
awatˆ
a (my reconstruction). As primitive Elvish evolved towards Quenya as
we know it, the second of two identical short vowels in concomitant syllables
was often lost; hence awatˆ
a would have been shortened to aw’tˆ
a = autˆ
a, and
this in turn is the direct ancestor of Quenya auta-. But it seems that the
old past tense of such a verb as awatˆ
a, with a vowel immediately preceding
the ending -tˆ
a, was formed by nasal-inﬁxion: Tolkien explicitly gave the past
tense of the primitive verb as awantˆ
e (WJ:366; the spelling there used is ac-
tually ´
awa-n-tˆ
e, the hyphens before and after the n apparently emphasizing
that it is an inﬁx – whereas the accent on the initial ´
a here only means that
it is stressed, not that the vowel is long).
In the case of a word like awantˆ
e, the rule that the second of two identical
short vowels is lost could not apply (no **aw’ntˆ
e), for such loss does not
occur immediately in front of a consonant cluster – and the nasal-inﬁxion
has here produced a cluster nt. The “ﬁnal” Quenya form of awantˆ
e, namely
oant¨
e, is somewhat obscured because the group awa later became oa in
Quenya – but this change has nothing to do with the past tense forma-
tion. Now we can explain a form like oront¨
e as the past tense of orta-:
In the Etymologies, the original root is given as oro (LR:379), so Tolkien
probably meant the verb orta- to be descended from older orotˆ
a- after the
regular loss of the second vowel. But the past tense of this orotˆ
a- was the
nasal-inﬁxed form orontˆ
e (both are my reconstructions), and this produced
Quenya oront¨
e, the second vowel here being preserved because of the fol-
lowing cluster nt (no one wants to say **ornt¨
e!)
When Tolkien apparently changed his mind and altered the past tense
of orta- from oront¨
e to ortan¨
e (a “regular” form according to the sys-
tem we have set out), this would seem to suggest that he had now decided
112


that the primitive forms were instead ortˆ
a- with past tense orta-nˆ
e: There
was never any vowel immediately in front of the ending -tˆ
a after all, and
therefore the past tense was not formed by nasal-inﬁxion, but by the inde-
pendent ending -nˆ
e (> Quenya -n¨
e). This is not the only example of Tolkien
apparently changing his mind about which verbs actually belong to this ex-
clusive “class”. The Etymologies lists a verb atalta- “collapse, fall in” (entry
tal´
at); no past tense is there mentioned, but in one text we have atalant¨
e
(LR:56, translated “down-fell”). This would seem to presuppose that the
primitive forms were atalatˆ
a- with past tense atalantˆ
e (my reconstructions,
but cf. WJ:319 regarding atalat as a derivative form of the root talat).
Yet in Tolkien’s later texts the past tense of atalta- becomes ataltan¨
e
(LR:47 and SD:247), simply formed by adding the normal ending -n¨
e. So
now Tolkien had presumably come to envision the primitive forms as ataltˆ
a-,
past tense atalta-nˆ
e (my reconstructions).
If the apparent revisions oront¨
e > ortan¨
e and atalant¨
e > ataltan¨
e do
not reﬂect changes in his ideas about the primitive Elvish forms, it may
be that he imagined a development whereby the Eldar replaced the more
complex past tense formations with simpler, analogical forms. For instance,
oront¨
e as past tense of orta- could have been replaced by ortan¨
e because
of analogy with such straightforward past tense formations as hehta-, pa.t.
hehtan¨
e (WJ:365). In the Etymologies, the form oront¨
e is indeed marked
with a symbol that indicates that it is “poetic or archaic” (cf. LR:347); is this
to suggest that it was ordinarily replaced by the “non-archaic” form ortan¨
e?
Especially considering how Tolkien later came to envision the history of the
Quenya tongue – that it was used as a ceremonial language in Middle-earth,
but was no longer anyone’s mother-tongue – we could very plausibly assume
that its grammar was somewhat simpliﬁed, more complex formations being
suppressed and replaced by simpler analogical ones. Indeed oant¨
e rather
than **autan¨
e as the past tense of auta- “to leave” is the only verb I can
think of where we “must” use this special past tense formation, unless we
are to accept some of the earliest “Qenya” material with no reservations
(and I have plenty).
With this we conclude our survey of various strange or irregular ways of
forming the past tense; as I said above, the exercises below are meant to
reﬂect the regular system instead.
Remember that just like present-tense verbs, a past tense form receives
the ending -r if it has a plural subject (or multiple subjects). For instance,
the simplest past tense of the verb lanta- “fall” is lantan¨
e, but with a plural
subject it becomes lantaner (SD:246). Naturally, he diaeresis over the ﬁnal
-¨
e disappears, since the vowel is no longer ﬁnal when the plural ending -r is
added after it.
113


Summary of Lesson Six
While various irregular formations occur, it would seem that the past tense
of Quenya verbs is typically formed according to these rules: A-stem verbs
simply receive the ending -n¨
e. The “primary” or ending-less verbs can also
receive this ending if their last consonant is -r or -m, probably also -n (no
examples). If added to a primary verb in -l, the ending -n¨
e turns into -l¨
e
(resulting in a double ll, e.g. vill¨
e as the past tense of vil- “ﬂy”). Primary
verbs ending in one of the consonants p, t, c have past tenses constructed
by adding the ending -¨
e combined with nasal-inﬁxion intruding before the
last consonant of the verbal stem; the inﬁx manifests as m before p (hence
tomp¨
e as the past tense of top- “cover”), otherwise as n (hence mant¨
e as
the past tense of mat- “eat”).

Lesson 7
Future tense and Aorist
7.1
The future tense
In this lesson we will introduce two new tenses of the verb, the future and
the aorist. We shall have to spend quite a few paragraphs trying to deﬁne
the function of the latter, but the function of the future tense is easy enough
to grasp: This tense is used with reference to future actions.
English (unlike, say, French) has no distinct future tense. Instead of a uni-
tary, inﬂectional form of the verb that only refers to future actions, English
may fall back on longer phrases involving extra verbs like “shall” or “will”:
A past tense form like “came” has no one-word counterpart with future
reference that would exemplify a true future tense – we only ﬁnd circumlo-
cutions like “shall come” or “will come” (or even “is going to come”). It is
even possible to use the present tense with future reference: “He comes to-
morrow.” For this reason, linguists may refer to the English “present” tense
as a non-past tense instead: It actually covers both present and future.
These somewhat asymmetric features of English are avoided in Tolkien’s
Elvish. Languages like Quenya and Sindarin do possess true future tense
forms of the verb. For instance, the future tense of the verb hir- “ﬁnd” ap-
pears near the end of Nam´
ari¨
e, in the sentence nai ely¨
e hiruva, “maybe
thou shalt ﬁnd [it]”. The example hiruva “shall (shalt) ﬁnd” includes what
seems to be the normal – possibly universal – Quenya future tense marker:
the ending -uva. This pattern is conﬁrmed by the Markirya poem, that in-
cludes the examples cenuva “shall heed”, tiruva “shall watch” and hlaruva
“shall hear” (verbs cen- “see, behold, heed”, tir- “watch”, hlar- “hear”). In
LR:63, Tolkien translates the verb queluva as “faileth”, but this is only an
example of the English “present” or non-past tense embracing the future as
well. The context clearly indicates that the verbal action in question belongs
to the future: Man t´
ar¨
e ant´
ava nin Il´
uvatar, Il´
uvatar, eny´
ar¨
e tar i
tyel ´
ır¨
e Anarinya queluva? “What will Il´
uvatar, O Il´
uvatar, give me in
that day beyond the end, when my Sun faileth [literally: shall fail]?”
The examples listed so far exemplify the future tense of “primary” or
116


ending-less verbs only. It seems that the ending -uva is also used in the case
of the more numerous A-stem verbs, which however lose their ﬁnal -a before
the future tense ending is added (one exception, see note below). In a post-
LotR source, the future tense of the verb linda- “sing” appears as linduva
(attested with a secondary ending here removed; see Taum Santoski’s article
in the October 1985 issue of the newsletter Beyond Bree). Also, what must
be the future tense of the A-stem verb ora- “to urge, impel” is apparently
given as oruva in another post-LotR source (VT41:13, 18; Tolkien actually
wrote oruv·, but the editor points out that “the dot may be an inadvertently
incomplete a”: No Quenya word can end in -v.)
NOTE: Notice, however, that a ﬁnal -a does not drop out before the ending -uva when
this -a is also the only vowel of the verbal stem. Thus, the future tense form of the copulas
derived from the stem nˆ
a “to be” (cf. n´
a “is”) is not **nuva, but nauva: This word for
“will be” is attested in VT42:34.
It may be that Tolkien at one point imagined a somewhat more com-
plicated system regarding the A-stems. Above we quoted a line from the
pre-LotR Quenya text usually called F´
ıriel’s Song, including ant´
ava as the
future tense of anta- “give” (LR:63, 72). Here Tolkien seems to be using
a system whereby A-stem verbs form their future tense by lengthening the
ﬁnal -a to -´
a and adding the ending -va (shorter variant of -uva?) However,
in light of the later examples linduva and oruva (instead of **lind´
ava,
**or´
ava), we may conclude that Tolkien eventually decided to make -uva
the more or less universal future tense marker: This ending simply causes
the ﬁnal -a of A-stems to drop out. My best guess is that in LotR-style
Quenya, the future tense of anta- should be antuva rather than ant´
ava,
since Tolkien may seem to have simpliﬁed the system.
However, there is one possible complication in LotR-style Quenya as well,
regarding the primary verbs. In Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR occurs the future tense
form enquantuva, “shall reﬁll”. Removing the preﬁx en- “re-”, we have
quantuva for “shall ﬁll”. This used to be taken as the future tense of a verb
quanta- “to ﬁll”, related to the adjective quanta “full”. Tolkien’s earliest
“Qenya” wordlist indeed lists such a verb (QL:78, there spelt qanta-). How-
ever, about half a decade after publishing LotR, Tolkien in the essay Quendi
and Eldar seemingly cited the Quenya verb “to ﬁll” as quat- (WJ:392). This
would seem to be a primary verb, past tense presumably quant¨
e (the pa.t.
“qante” is actually given in QL:78, but there it is evidently only meant as a
permissible shortening of the full form “qantane”; the regular past tense of
a verb quanta- would be quantan¨
e in later Quenya as well). If Tolkien had
decided that the Quenya verb “to ﬁll” is actually quat-, and its future tense
is quantuva as Nam´
ari¨
e would seem to indicate, should we conclude that
the same verbs that form their past tense with nasal-inﬁxion + the ending
-¨
e similarly form their future tense with nasal-inﬁxion + the ending -uva?
For instance, should the future tense of verbs like mat- “eat”, top- “cover”
and tac- “fasten” be mantuva “shall eat”, tompuva “shall cover”, tan-
117


cuva “shall fasten”? (Compare the nasal-inﬁxion in the past tense forms:
mant¨
e, tomp¨
e, tanc¨
e.) Or should we just add the ending -uva to the
verbal stem without any further manipulations, hence matuva, topuva,
tacuva instead? General principles would perhaps suggest the latter, but
there remains the curious example of quantuva next to quat-. If there is
to be no nasal-inﬁxion in the future tense forms, we would have to accept
that the verb “ﬁll” can be both quanta- and quat-, with separate future
tenses quantuva and quatuva.
I have used future tense forms with nasal-inﬁxion in certain compositions
of my own (and so have some people who put greater trust in my so-called
“expert opinion” than they possibly should). But it may well be that Tolkien,
mentioning the form quat- in WJ:392, actually intended this to be simply
the way the underlying root kwata manifests in Quenya. The exact wording
in the source involves a reference to “the verb stem *kwata, Q quat- ‘ﬁll’.”
If quat- is merely the way the ancient stem kwata appears in Quenya, the
actual verb “ﬁll” could still be quanta- with future tense quantuva. (Com-
pare for instance the entry pat in the Etymologies, this root pat producing
the Quenya verb panta- “open”. There is also an adjective panta “open”,
exactly parallelling quanta “full” next to the verb quanta- “ﬁll”; perhaps
the verb is derived from the adjective in both cases.)
Alternatively, quat- really is the verb “to ﬁll” and not just an underlying
root-form, but the future tense quantuva still presupposes a longer A-
stem quanta-. Perhaps Tolkien had just plain forgotten that he had already
published a form of the A-stem verb quanta- “ﬁll”, so that he was no longer
free to change it to a primary verb quat-. (See PM:367-371 for an example
of Tolkien working out some elaborate linguistic explanations that he had
to scrap because he discovered that they conﬂicted with something he had
already published in LotR – a fatal footnote in an Appendix forcing him to
reject his nice new ideas!)
Thus, material presently available does not allow any certain conclusion in
this matter. Writers can equally plausibly let verbs that show nasal inﬁxion
in the past tense do so also in the future tense (arguing from the quat-
/quantuva pair that this is how the language works) or choose to explain
quat- diﬀerently and form the future tense of any primary verb simply
by adding the ending -uva (as in hir-/hiruva). As users of Quenya we
can probably well aﬀord to live with slightly diﬀerent dialects regarding
this detail, until future publications hopefully allow us to pick the right
explanation.
It must be assumed that the future tense, like all other tenses, receives
the ending -r where it occurs with a plural subject (e.g. elen siluva “a star
will shine”, but plural eleni siluvar “stars will shine”).

7.2
The Aorist
We have now discussed all the three tenses corresponding to the basic trinity
of past, present, and future. Yet the Quenya verb has other tenses as well.
One is called the aorist. The use of this term with reference to Quenya
grammar was long disputed by some, but a Tolkien text that ﬁnally became
available in July 2000 demonstrates that he had indeed invented a Quenya
tense he called aorist (VT41:17).
While even people with no linguistic training readily understand what the
past, present and future tenses are “for”, it is hardly equally obvious what
function the aorist tense has. (Some linguists would say that the aorist is
strictly not a “tense” at all, according to certain deﬁnitions of that term;
however, Tolkien did use the phrase “aorist tense” in VT41:17. We will not
discuss this question here, wholly academic as it is.) So what, really, is an
aorist?
To start with the word itself, it comes from Greek and literally means
something like “unlimited” or “undetermined”. The word was originally
coined to describe a certain Greek form of the verb. In Greek this form
contrasts with the past tense or “imperfect”, the latter being used of a past
action that was being done over a period of time (not just a momentary
action). The aorist, on the other hand, has no such implications regarding
the “duration” of the action. It just denotes a past action, period, with no
further distinctions. When contrasted with the imperfect, the Greek aorist
can be used for a momentary or clearly ﬁnished (not on-going) action. An-
other use of the Greek aorist is not especially associated with the past: the
aorist could be used to express general truths that are not limited to any
speciﬁc time, like “sheep eat grass”.
But this was the Greek aorist; the Quenya aorist is not used in quite the
same way. Yet their functions do overlap in some respects, which must be
the reason why Tolkien decided to employ this term from Greek grammar
in the ﬁrst place. We will try to determine the function of the Quenya aorist
before we discuss how it is actually formed. For now, just take my word that
the verbs in the examples I cite are aorists.
The Quenya aorist, like the Greek one, can be used to express “gen-
eral truths”. Our best example is a sentence occurring in WJ:391, where
Elves are described as i carir quettar ´
omainen, “those who make words
with voices”. The aorist verb carir “make” here denotes a general habit
of the Elves, covering past, present and future, for the Elves were making
words throughout their history. The sentence polin quet¨
e “I can speak”
(VT41:6) includes another aorist verb, and again a “general truth” is pre-
sented, though in this case it relates only to the speaker: The meaning is of
course “I can (always) speak”, presenting a general ability, not just some-
thing that applies only to the present time (as if the speaker was dumb
yesterday and may go dumb again tomorrow). So one imporant function of
119


the Quenya aorist is that it is used, or rather can be used, of verbal actions
that transcend the here and now – rather describing some “timeless” truth
or “general” situation. In Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR, Galadriel describes the gloomy
state of Middle-earth using an aorist verb: sindan´
oriello caita morni¨
e
“out of a grey country darkness lies” (not present tense cait¨
ea = “is lying”,
as if this were merely a strictly present phenomenon, soon to pass). The ﬁrst
words of Nam´
ari¨
e also include an aorist: lauri¨
e lantar lassi, “like gold fall
the leaves” – but this is not just a here-and-now description of leaves that are
falling (which would presumably be lant¨
ear, present tense): The following
lines indicate that Galadriel describes the general situation in Middle-earth,
the ever-recurring autumnal decay as she has been observing it throughout
y´
eni ´
un´
otim¨
e, “long years uncountable”. So our example “sheep eat grass”
is probably best rendered into Quenya using an aorist verb: m´
amar matir
salqu¨
e (singular “sheep” = m´
ama, “grass” = salqu¨
e). As the example
polin quet¨
e “I can speak” demonstrates, the aorist can also be used to
describe the abilities or habits of a single individual (i m´
ama mat¨
e salqu¨
e
= “the sheep eats grass”).
It seems, however, that the Quenya aorist is not only used to describe
“timeless truths”. In some cases Tolkien himself seems to waver in the choice
between the aorist and the present tense, the latter more typically describing
an ongoing here-and-now situation. This hesitation on Tolkien’s part suggest
that these tenses are to some extent interchangeable. We have an aorist in
the sentence ´
orenya quet¨
e nin “my heart tells me” (VT41:11), which is
apparently quite synonymous with the alternative wording ´
orenya qu´
eta
nin (VT41:13) employing a present tense form instead of an aorist. In the
famous greeting elen s´
ıla l´
umenn’ omentielvo, “a star shines [or rather
is shining] on the hour of our meeting”, Tolkien ﬁnally decided to use a
present tense form – but in earlier drafts, he used an aorist sil¨
e instead
(RS:324). This greeting, having relevance for “our meeting” only, obviously
cannot describe any “general truth” transcending time. Yet it is apparently
permissible to use an aorist form even in such a context (though Tolkien
decided that it was better to use the present tense).
It should be noted that the Quenya aorist is generally associated with
the present, not with the past as in Greek. As Jerry Caveney wrote about
Tolkien on the Elﬂing list (August 3, 2000):
In what seems to me typical of his creativeness and ‘fun’ in cre-
ating languages, he took the idea of the aorist aspect, and said,
in eﬀect, ‘What if a language used the aorist to contrast present
general (unlimited) actions to present continuative actions in-
stead of using it to contrast past general actions to present con-
tinuative [as in classical Greek]?’ The result is Tolkien’s ‘present
aorist’. :) He thus created a language that could distinguish con-
tinuative from general present actions simply, something classi-
120


cal Greek could not readily do, and which modern English and
French, for example, can only do with extra words (I walk, I
am walking; je marche, je suis en train de marcher). I suspect
Tolkien enjoyed the elegance of this basic grammatical distinc-
tion, which I am not aware that any ‘living’ language has.
On the other hand, Carl F. Hostetter thinks the Quenya aorist is used
to describe an action that is “punctual, habitual, or otherwise durationless”
(VT41:15). This is probably correct in most cases, describing the typical
function of the aorist. Yet some examples suggest that it may be better to
say that whereas the present tense explicitly identiﬁes an ongoing action, the
Quenya aorist is simply unmarked as far as duration is concerned. It does
not necessarily contrast with the continuative present tense; an aorist as
such does not signal that a verbal action must be non-continuative or “du-
rationless”. Rather, as Caveney says, it is a “general” form, an all-purpose
“present tense” that simply doesn’t address the question of whether the
action denoted is continuative, habitual or momentary. As Luk´
aˇ
s Nov´
ak ob-
served on the Elﬂing list (August 1, 2000): “It seems that the aorist is so
‘aoristos’ [Greek: unlimited] that it can express almost everything.”
In the exclamation auta i l´
om¨
e! “the night is passing” (Silmarillion ch.
20), the form auta would seem to be an aorist (contrasting with the present
tense, which is probably aut¨
ea) – yet Tolkien employs the translation “is
passing” rather than “passes”. So it would seem that the aorist can also be
used for an ongoing action; it just isn’t explicitly marked as such, grammat-
ically speaking. If this is correct, it would be diﬃcult to pin down any case
where it is palpably wrong to replace the present tense with an aorist. Using
the aorist would be simply a rather neutral way of talking about “present”
actions – whether such action is actually ongoing, habitual, or merely an
expression of “general truths”. (Hence m´
amar matir salqu¨
e = “sheep
eat grass” could also be understood as “sheep are eating grass”, though
for this meaning it is probably better – but hardly mandatory – to use the
present tense: m´
atar.) In choosing between the aorist and the present tense,
the only hard-and-fast rule one has to go on seems to be that the present
tense should not be used with reference to entirely duration-less actions:
The Quenya present tense is always used about some kind of continuous
action. (Indeed some students would dispense with the term “present tense”
and rather speak of the “continuative” form.) Beyond this one restriction, it
seems that writers can choose quite freely between the aorist and the present
tense.
Generally, however, it seems that the Quenya aorist corresponds to the
English simple present (that shows either the ending -s or no ending at
all, depending on the grammatical context). So Tolkien often translated
Quenya aorists: e.g. top¨
e “covers” (LR:394), mac¨
e “hews” (VT39:11), tirin
“I watch” (LR:394). The Quenya present tense, on the other hand, is often
121


best translated using the English “is . . .-ing” construction: t´
opa “is cov-
ering”, m´
aca “is hewing”, t´
ıran “I am watching”. (The ending -n in the
examples tirin/t´
ıran, as well as in the form polin “I can” cited above, sig-
niﬁes “I”: This suﬃx will be discussed in the next lesson.) In Lesson Five we
pointed out that the present tense form qu´
eta denotes “is saying” rather
than just “says”; conversely, the aorist quet¨
e is usually “says” rather than
“is saying”. If the Quenya aorist is used somewhat like the English simple
present tense, the aorist can be used to describe actions that are perceived as
duration-less or habitual. For instance, an aorist like cap¨
e “jumps” may de-
scribe an action that is momentary (“he jumps”) or habitual/characteristic
(“any frog jumps”).
Yet we also seem to have examples of Tolkien using the Quenya present/
“continuous” tense instead of the aorist where English would still translate
the verb in question as a simple present tense form, not as an “is . . .-ing”
construction. Consider this line from Nam´
ari¨
e: h´
ısi¨
e unt´
upa Calaciryo
m´
ıri “mist covers the jewels of Calacirya”. The present tense form unt´
upa
describes a continuous action, more literally “is covering”, but here Tolkien
wrote “covers” instead. Presumably it would in no way have been wrong
to use an aorist instead. After all, the mist covering the jewels of Calacirya
is evidently perceived as a rather general state of things, not merely as an
ongoing meteorological phenomenon that will soon pass! (The aorist would
presumably be untup¨
e – perhaps this form, stressed on the ﬁrst rather
than the penultimate syllable, just didn’t ﬁt the meter of Tolkien’s poem?
Anyhow, the latter element of this verb untup- seems to be a variant of
top- in the Etymologies, both verbs meaning “cover”.)
Another example of a present tense where we might expect to see an
aorist can be found in Cirion’s Oath (UT:305, 317), in the sentence i h´
arar
mahalmassen mi N´
umen = “those who sit on thrones in the West”. This
refers to the Valar, and their being enthroned in the West must be considered
a “general truth”, just like it is a general truth that Elves make (aorist carir)
words with voices. Yet Tolkien used what seems to be a present tense instead
of an aorist: h´
ara, here plural h´
arar, apparently suggesting a primary verb
har- “to sit”. The plural aorist would probably be harir instead. It may be
noted that while Tolkien translated h´
arar as “sit” in the running English
translation in UT:305, he employed the more literal translation “are sitting”
in his linguistic discussion in UT:317. Yet this seems to demonstrate that
in Quenya, one can use the present tense as well as the aorist to describe
also a general state of things. After all, the Valar’s agelong state of being
enthroned is also after a fashion “continuous”. Cf. also the sentence yonya
iny¨
e tye-m´
ela, “I too, my son, I love thee” (LR:61), where Tolkien uses a
present tense instead of an aorist: Literally iny¨
e tye-m´
ela would seem to
mean “I am loving you”, but the reference must be to a quite “permanent”
emotional state. If anyone else that Tolkien had written this, I would strongly
advice the writer to use an aorist (mel¨
e) instead of m´
ela – actually I still
122


think the aorist would be better in this context, even though it was Tolkien
who wrote this! But this example conﬁrms that the present tense can also
be used to describe “general truths” or more or less permanent situations,
though this is more typically the domain of the aorist.
I can well imagine that after this discussion, the student wonders if there
is any point in maintaining the aorist and the present as distinct tenses,
since their functions seem to overlap to such an extent – the only concrete
rule being that if some kind of present action cannot in any way be seen
as continuous, but is entirely duration-less, one must use the aorist. In just
about all other contexts, either tense will apparently do, and the use of the
aorist may not necessarily imply that an action has to be duration-less: For
instance, it could also describe a “general truth”, or indeed an ongoing action
(as in auta = “is passing”). The context must be taken into consideration.
I can only say that I didn’t make this language (another guy did. . . )
Perhaps future publications will throw more light on whatever subtle dis-
tinctions Tolkien had in mind. But in the exercises I made for this course,
I have consistently used aorists for the English simple present, whereas I
use the Quenya present tense for the English “is . . .-ing” construction. I do
think writers transposing English usage to Quenya using this formula would
get it right (or rather, wouldn’t make palpable mistakes!) most of the time.
That was the function of the aorist, diﬃcult though it is to pin down.
Now we must discuss how the Quenya aorist is actually formed.
It seems that in Primitive Elvish, the rules for how the aorist is constructed
were quite simple: In the case of a “derived” or A-stem verb, the aorist tense
is simply identical to the verbal stem itself (irrespective of the fact that the
aorist can of course receive such secondary endings as the plural marker
-r, where such is required). No explicit tense-marker had to be present.
Regarding the A-stems, this system persists in Quenya. The aorist of a verb
like lanta- “to fall” is simply lanta “falls” (occurring in Nam´
ari¨
e, there
with the plural ending -r to agree with its plural subject “leaves”: lauri¨
e
lantar lassi, “golden fall [the] leaves”).
In the case of the “primary” or ending-less verbs like mat- “to eat”,
they originally (in Primitive Elvish) formed their aorist tense by adding
the ending -i: “Eats” apparently used to be mati. It is somewhat arguable
whether the ending -i is here strictly an aorist tense-marker. If so, we might
have expected to see it in the formation of A-stem aorists as well. Perhaps
the rule for aorist formation in Primitive Elvish should rather be stated
like this: The aorist is normally identical to the verbal stem, but in the
case of “primary” or ending-less verbal stems, they receive the ending -i
as a kind of stopgap to make up for the absence of any other ending. (I
should add that this “simpliﬁed” view is not wholly unproblematic, but it
works most of the time.) This system essentially persists in Quenya, but
the phonological development occurring since Primitive Elvish has added
one minor complication: Where ﬁnal, the short -i of Primitive Elvish was
123


at some point changed to -¨
e. (For instance, the Quenya noun rinc¨
e “quick
shake” is said to descend from primitive rinki: See the entry rik(h) in the
Etymologies. Where Quenya has ﬁnal -i, it is normally shortened from long
-ˆ
ı in the primitive language.) Hence the old form mati “eats” had turned
into mat¨
e in Quenya. But since this change only occurred where -i was ﬁnal,
we still see mati- if the aorist form is to receive any ending, such as -r in
the case of a plural subject. Hence Nauco mat¨
e “a Dwarf eats”, but with
a plural subject Naucor matir “Dwarves eat”. The ending “shielded” the
ﬁnal -i so that it was not really ﬁnal at all, and therefore it did not change
to -¨
e.
NOTE 1: There are a few examples of what seems to be aorist forms where the ending -¨
e
persists in the form -e- even if the aorist receives an ending. For instance, what must be the
plural aorist of the verb ettul- “come forth” appears as ettuler (instead of the expected
form ettulir) in SD:290. Perhaps Tolkien at one stage imagined that the primitive ending
-i had become -e in all positions, even where it was not ﬁnal – like ettulir being altered to
ettuler on analogy with the ending-less form ettul¨
e. But this seems to have been just a
passing “phase” in Tolkien’s evolution of Quenya: In our best late source, the essay Quendi
and Eldar of about 1960, the plural aorist of car- “do, make” appears as carir, not **carer
(WJ:391). Hence Tolkien had reestablished the system he had also used a quarter of a
century earlier, in the Etymologies. – The form ettuler is (apparently) translated “are at
hand” in SD:290; a more literal translation would presumably be “are coming forth”. This
would conﬁrm that it may be permissible to use the aorist also for ongoing actions; this
tense is simply unmarked regarding the duration of the action, whereas the “present” or
“continuous/continuative” tense explicitly identiﬁes an action as ongoing. In our exercises,
we will nonetheless use the aorist in the most “typical” way (to denote actions that are
momentary or habitual/timeless).
NOTE 2: In the case of primary verbs, the aorist and the present tense diﬀer not
only regarding the ending. In the present tense, the stem-vowel is lengthened (m´
ata “is
eating”), whereas in the aorist, it stays short (mat¨
e “eats”). Yet there are a very few
strange forms in our corpus that look like aorists by their ending, but still show a long
stem-vowel, e.g. t´
ap¨
e “stops, blocks” (Etym, entry tap). We would expect tap¨
e with
a short vowel (it is tempting to believe that the accent above a is just an ink-smear in
Tolkien’s manuscript. . . ) – It may also be noted that a few derived verbs (A-stems) include
an “intrinsically” long vowel, e.g. c´
una- “bend”, s´
uya- “breathe” or m´
ota- “labour, toil”.
To use the latter verb as an example, its aorist would presumably be m´
ota, even though
this may look like the present tense of a non-existing primary verb **mot-. (We must
assume that the actual present tense of m´
ota would be m´
ot¨
ea.)
Summary of Lesson Seven
In Quenya, the future tense is formed with the ending -uva. When added
to an A-stem, the -a of the stem drops out before this ending; for instance,
the future tense of the verb linda- “sing” is linduva (not **lindauva).
124


Quenya also has a tense termed aorist, which diﬀers from the present tense
in that the latter explicitly describes an on-going action. The aorist says
nothing about the duration of the action, and while the use of an aorist
form does not preclude that the action denoted is drawn-out or on-going,
it seems that this tense is more typically used to describe duration-less,
punctual, habitual, characteristic or altogether timeless actions. An example
of an aorist is quet¨
e = “speaks”, as opposed to present tense qu´
eta “is
speaking”. It may be that the Quenya aorist corresponds quite well to the
English simple present tense (“speaks”), whereas the Quenya present tense
rather corresponds to the English “is . . .-ing” construction (“is speaking”).
In the case of A-stem verbs, the aorist is identical to the verbal stem itself
(irrespective of any secondary endings the aorist verb may receive). In the
case of primary verbs, the aorist tense is formed by means of the ending
-i, which however changes to -¨
e if no secondary ending (e.g. -r for plural)
is to follow. Hence the aorist of mat- “to eat” is mat¨
e “eats” if there is
no further ending added to the word, but otherwise we see mati- + ending
(e.g. matir “eat” in the case of a plural subject).

Lesson 8
Perfect tense. Pronominal endings -n(y¨
e), -l(y¨
e), -s.
8.1
The perfect tense
Tolkien certainly imagined the Quenya verb to have more tenses than the
ones that appear in published material, but only one of these known tenses
now remains to be discussed. The last known Quenya tense is the perfect.
(There are still other forms of the verb that we shall have to discuss later,
such as the inﬁnitive, the gerund and the imperative, but these don’t count
as tenses.)
Linguistically speaking, English has no perfect tense, just as English has
no future tense. However, just as the language quite regularly expresses the
idea of futurity by involving extra verbs like “shall” or “will”, so the meaning
of a true perfect tense is typically achieved by means of a circumlocution
involving the verb “have”. For instance, some typical English constructions
doing the job of a perfect tense are seen in these sentences: “Peter has left”,
“the guests have eaten” (as opposed to a mere past tense: “Peter left”,
“the guests ate”). The perfect tense thus describes an action that itself is
past, but by using the perfect tense one emphasizes that this past action
is somehow still directly relevant for the present moment: “Peter has left
[and he is still gone]”, “the guests have eaten [and they are hopefully still
satiated as we speak]”, etc. – In English at least, such constructions may
also be used to describe an action that started in the past and still goes on
in the present moment: “The king has ruled (or, has been ruling) for many
years.”
Quenya, unlike English, does have a true perfect tense – a unitary form
of the verb that expresses this meaning, without circumlocutions and extra
verbs. Several examples of this perfect tense occurs in LotR. Two of them
are found in the chapter The Steward and the King in Volume 3. The ﬁrst
example is from Elendil’s Declaration, repeated by Aragorn during his coro-
nation. It goes, in part: Et E¨
arello Endorenna ut´
ulien = “Out of the
Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come [or: I have come].” Removing the end-
ing -n meaning “I”, we ﬁnd that the naked present tense “have/has come”
127


is ut´
uli¨
e (according to the spelling conventions here employed, we must add
a diaeresis to -e when it becomes ﬁnal). Later in the same chapter, Aragorn
ﬁnds the sapling of the White Tree, and exclaims: Y´
e! ut´
uvienyes! “I have
found it!” (The word y´
e is not translated; it is apparently simply an exclama-
tion “Yes!” or “Yeah!”) Ut´
uvienyes can be broken down as ut´
uvie-nye-s
“have found-I-it”. We are thus left with ut´
uvi¨
e as the perfect tense of a verb
tuv- “ﬁnd”. (This verb is not otherwise attested, unless it can be equated
with a verb tuvu- “receive” found in very early [1917] material; see GL:71.
Whether this tuv- somehow diﬀers in meaning from hir-, we cannot know.
In the exercises of this course, I always use hir- for “ﬁnd”.)
A post-LotR example of a Quenya perfect tense is found in VT39:9,
Tolkien mentioning a form ir´
ıci¨
e “has twisted” – evidently the perfect tense
of a primary verb ric- “twist” (not otherwise attested, but the Etymolo-
gies lists a primitive root rik(h)- “jerk, sudden move”). As stated above,
the form ut´
uvi¨
e “has found” seems to presuppose a verb tuv- “ﬁnd”, and
ut´
uli¨
e “has come” is the perfect tense of a verb tul- “come” that is at-
tested in the Etymologies (entry tul-). From these examples it is clear that
the perfect tense is formed with the ending -i¨
e, but the stem of the verb is
also manipulated in other ways. In the case of primary verbs at least, the
stem-vowel is lengthened: ut´
uvi¨
e, ut´
uli¨
e, ir´
ıci¨
e.
The ardent student will remember that a similar lengthening occurs in
the present tense (we would have t´
uva “is ﬁnding”, t´
ula “is coming”, r´
ıca
“is twisting”), but the perfect tense formation diﬀers from the present tense
not only in the fact that the former receives the ending -i¨
e instead of -a.
The perfect, alone of all known Quenya tenses, also receives a kind of preﬁx.
This preﬁx is variable in form, for it is always the same as the stem-vowel
(but short). Hence the verbs tuv- “ﬁnd” and tul- “come” become ut´
uvi¨
e
and ut´
uli¨
e in the perfect (I underline the preﬁx), since their stem-vowel is
u. On the other hand, the verb ric- “twist”, with the stem-vowel i, turns
into ir´
ıci¨
e in the perfect tense. Further examples (constructed by me, with
underlining of stem-vowel and preﬁx):
Stem-vowel A: mat- “eat” vs. am´
ati¨
e “has eaten”
Stem-vowel E: cen- “see” vs. ec´
eni¨
e “has seen”
Stem-vowel I : tir- “watch” vs. it´
ıri¨
e “has watched”
Stem-vowel O: not- “reckon” vs. on´
oti¨
e “has reckoned”
Stem-vowel U : tur- “govern” vs. ut´
uri¨
e “has governed”
The preﬁx seen in the perfect tense is usually referred to as the augment.
It may also be noted that the process of “copying” or “repeating” a part of
a word, like the preﬁxing of stem-vowels seen here, is by a linguistic term
called reduplication. So to use as many fancy words as possible, one feature
of the Quenya perfect tense is that it includes a reduplicated stem-vowel that
is preﬁxed as an augment.
So far we have only used examples involving primary verbs. The evidence
128


is actually extremely scarce regarding derived (A-stem) verbs. General prin-
ciples suggest that they would drop the ﬁnal -a before the ending -i¨
e is
added. For instance, the perfect tense of lala- “laugh” or mapa- “seize” is
presumably al´
ali¨
e “has laughed”, am´
api¨
e “has seized”. (Where such a verb
has a long stem-vowel, it presumably just stays long in the perfect, where
it would have been lengthened anyway. The augment should probably al-
ways be a short vowel, though; hence a verb like m´
ota- “toil” may have the
perfect tense om´
oti¨
e “has toiled”.)
However, very many A-stems have a consonant cluster following the stem-
vowel, e.g. rn following the ﬁrst A in a verb like harna- “wound”. Since
Quenya isn’t fond of long vowels immediately in front of consonant clusters,
we must assume that the lengthening of the stem-vowels simply does not
occur in verbs of this shape. Otherwise the perfect tense would be formed
according to the normal rules: reduplicate the stem-vowel as an augment and
replace ﬁnal -a with the ending -i¨
e (so “has wounded” would be aharni¨
e, not
**ah´
arni¨
e). We may have some attested examples of augment-less perfects
that are seen to skip the lengthening of the stem-vowel where there is a
consonant cluster following it (see below).
The numerous A-stems that end in -ya may be somewhat special. Take
a verb like hanya- “understand”. According to the rules so far given, the
perfect “has understood” should be **ahanyi¨
e (or even **ah´
anyi¨
e with
a lengthened vowel, for it is rather unclear whether ny here counts as a
consonant cluster or a unitary consonant – palatalized n like Spanish ˜
n).
However, such a form is impossible, for the combination yi does not occur
in Quenya.
We may have one example to guide us: In Nam´
ari¨
e, there occurs a perfect
tense av´
ani¨
e “has passed” (actually it appears in the plural: y´
eni av´
anier
ve lint¨
e yuldar lisse-miruv´
oreva = “years have passed like swift draughts
of the sweet mead” – notice that the perfect, like other tenses, receives the
ending -r when it occurs with a plural subject). In the essay Quendi and El-
dar of ca. 1960, Tolkien explained av´
ani¨
e (or v´
ani¨
e without the augment)
as being the perfect tense of the highly irregular verb auta- (WJ:366). But a
quarter of a century earlier, in the Etymologies, he had listed a verb vanya-
“go, depart, disappear” (see the entry wan). It is eminently possibly that
when he actually wrote Nam´
ari¨
e in the forties, he still thought of (a)v´
ani¨
e
as the perfect tense of this verb vanya-, though he would later come up
with another explanation (perhaps he wanted to eliminate the clash with
the adjective vanya “fair”, though the words would not be diﬃcult to dis-
tinguish in context?) If so, Tolkien gave away how to treat verbs in -ya: In
the perfect tense, the whole ending -ya is dropped before -i¨
e is added, and
what remains of the verb is treated just as if it were a primary verb. The
perfect tense would therefore show both augment and lengthening of the
stem-vowel, something like this:
129


hanya- “understand”, perfect ah´
ani¨
e “has understood”
hilya- “follow”, perfect ih´
ıli¨
e “has followed”
telya- “ﬁnish”, perfect et´
eli¨
e “has ﬁnished”
tulya- “lead”, perfect ut´
uli¨
e “has led”
Of course, from the perfect forms you cannot determine with certainty
what the original verb stem looks like. For instance, ih´
ıli¨
e could also be
the perfect of a primary verb **hil- or a short A-stem **hila-. In this case,
no such verb is known to exist, but ut´
uli¨
e would be the perfect not only
of tulya- “lead”, but also of the distinct primary verb tul- “come”. So
one must apparently depend on the context to ﬁnd out whether the perfect
ut´
uli¨
e is formed from tulya- (so that it means “has led”) or from tul- (so
that it means “has come”). Same with the perfect ah´
ari¨
e: this form would
mean “has possessed” if it is formed from harya, but “has sat, has been
sitting” if it is the perfect of har- (apparently a primary verb “sit”; only
the plural present tense h´
arar “are sitting” is attested: UT:305, 317).
Verbs including diphthongs: In some cases it may be somewhat diﬃcult
to determine what the stem-vowel is. Where a verb contains a diphthong in
-i or -u, it is probably the ﬁrst vowel of this diphthong that functions as an
augment in the perfect tense. For instance, the perfect tense of verbs like
taita- “prolong” or roita- “pursue” would probably be ataiti¨
e, oroiti¨
e, and
the perfect tense of hauta- “cease, take a rest” is presumably ahauti¨
e. (The
stem-vowel can hardly be lengthened when it’s part of a diphthong, so we
wouldn’t expect to see **at´
aiti¨
e, **or´
oiti¨
e, **ah´
auti¨
e.) The original roots
of these verbs are given in the Etymologies as tay, roy, khaw, respectively;
thus the proper stem-vowels of these verbs are seen to be a, o, a (again
respectively). The ﬁnal -i or -u seen in the Quenya diphthongs arise from
original consonants -y and -w, so they cannot count as stem-vowels.
Unaugmented perfects: The material contains some examples of perfect-
tense verbs that are constructed according to the rules set forth about,
except that they do not have any augment preﬁxed. MR:250 (reproducing
a post-LotR source) mentions a form f´
ıri¨
e “has breathed forth” or in later
usage “has died”; the augment is missing, though there is no reason to as-
sume that the “full” form if´
ıri¨
e would be wrong. (The actual translation of
f´
ıri¨
e given in MR:350 is “she hath breathed forth”, but no element meaning
“she” can be identiﬁed; it is evidently understood.) The verb av´
anier “have
passed” occurring in Nam´
ari¨
e was actually v´
anier with no augment in the
ﬁrst edition of LotR; Tolkien supplied the augment in the second edition
(1966). Before this, in the essay Quendi and Eldar of about 1960, he ex-
plained the unaugmented variant as being simply a variant form “appearing
in verse” (WJ:366). Adding a syllable, as Tolkien did when introducing the
full form av´
anier into the poem in 1966, actually doesn’t ﬁt the meter of
Nam´
ari¨
e very well – but he evidently decided to let grammatical accuracy
take priority.
130


In the other perfects occurring in LotR (ut´
ulien, ut´
uvienyes), the aug-
ment was present also in the ﬁrst edition of 1954–55. Nonetheless, it seems
that the whole idea of augmenting perfect-tense verbs appeared relatively
late in Tolkien’s evolution of Quenya. In early sources, the augment is miss-
ing. For instance, the phrase “the Eldar have come” appears as i·Eldar
tulier in Tolkien’s earliest “Qenya” (LT1:114, 270). The perfect of tul-
here appearing features the same ending -ie- as in LotR-style Quenya, but
the augment, as well as the lengthening of the stem-vowel, still have not been
introduced into the language. Updating this sentence to LotR-style Quenya
by implementing Tolkien’s later revisions would probably produce Eldar
ut´
ulier (with an augmented perfect and no article before Eldar when it
refers to the entire Elvish race).
In much later, but still pre-LotR, material, we ﬁnd lanti¨
e (with a plural
subject lantier) as a form of the verb lanta- “fall”: LR:56. These forms
would also seem to be unaugmented perfects, showing the ending -i¨
e char-
acteristic of this tense. True, Tolkien translated these forms as “fell” (lanti¨
e
nu huin¨
e “fell under shadow”, ¨
eari lantier “seas fell”) as if they represent
some kind of past tense form – not perfect “has/have fallen”. However, he
later noted that “the forms of past and perfect became progressively more
closely associated in Quenya” (WJ:366). If this is to mean that Quenya might
sometimes use the perfect where English would rather have a past tense, we
can explain “fell” rather than “has/have fallen” as a possible translation
of lanti¨
e/lantier. In SD:310, where Christopher Tolkien discusses a later
version of the text in question, he records how his father changed lantier
to lantaner – apparently substituting a true past tense form for a perfect-
used-as-past.
If lantier, sg. lanti¨
e, can indeed be considered a perfect tense form, it
would conﬁrm that the stem-vowel cannot be lengthened before a consonant
cluster (not **l´
anti¨
e). Around this stage, Tolkien had certainly introduced
such lengthening of the stem-vowel in the perfect; F´
ıriel’s Song has c´
arier
for “made” (or “they made”, since the plural ending -r is included). This
form of the verb car- “make, do” would seem to be another perfect-used-
as-past, judging from the translation. Since the stem-vowel is lengthened in
c´
arier, we must assume that it stays short in lantier for purely phonological
reasons: no long vowels are allowed before a consonant cluster. – It may be
that the absence of the augment in some early sources is simply due to the
fact that Tolkien had not invented it yet; in LotR-style Quenya I would
recommend alanti¨
e as the perfect tense of lanta- and ac´
ari¨
e as the perfect
of car-.
Nonetheless, the above-cited example f´
ıri¨
e “has breathed forth, has ex-
pired” from a post-LotR source (MR:250) would seem to indicate that even
in LotR-style Quenya, it is permissible to leave out the augment, construct-
ing the perfect simply by means of the ending -i¨
e + lengthening of the stem-
vowel if there is no consonant cluster following it. Possibly unaugmented
131


perfects are meant to be more common in spoken or informal language, and
in poetry one can leave out the augment if the extra syllable would spoil
the meter (hence v´
anier for av´
anier in Nam´
ari¨
e, though Tolkien changed
his mind in 1966 and introduced the full form). However, in the exercises I
made for this course, all perfect-tense forms do include the augment.
Verbs beginning in vowels: Verbs beginning in a vowel pose a problem.
Where a verb has a preﬁx beginning in a vowel, the augment may slip in
between the preﬁx and the most basic verbal stem. For instance, the verb
enyal- “recall, remember” is quite literally en-yal- “re-call”, where yal- and
not en- is the basic verbal stem incorporating the stem-vowel; in such a case
I would expect the perfect to be enay´
ali¨
e. But some verbs begin in a vowel
even without any preﬁxed element, e.g. anta- “give”. In such a case the ﬁrst
vowel is also the stem-vowel, here occurring without any consonant in front
of it. A verb may also include a preﬁx that happens to be identical to the
stem-vowel, e.g. onot- “count up” (formed from not- “reckon” with a preﬁx
o- meaning “together”, hence onot- is literally “reckon together”). Other
verbal stems already preﬁx the stem-vowel as a kind of intensiﬁcation, e.g.
atalta- “collapse, fall in” (vs. the verb talta- with a somewhat less harsh
meaning: “slope, slip, slide down”). In all of these cases, it is diﬃcult to
preﬁx the stem-vowel as an augment in the perfect tense. We cannot well
have a’anti¨
e for “has given”, o’on´
oti¨
e for “has counted up”, a’atalti¨
e for
“has collapsed”. So what do we get instead?
One popular assumption has been that in such cases, the entire ﬁrst sylla-
ble is reduplicated as an augment: Hence the perfect tense of a anta- “give”
would be ananti¨
e (antanti¨
e?), and so on. With the publication of Vinyar
Tengwar #41 in July 2000, this theory was almost conﬁrmed. It turns out
that in a late source, Tolkien listed or´
ori¨
e as the perfect tense of the verb
ora- “urge” (VT41:13, 18; actually this form is not explicitly identiﬁed as
the perfect tense, but it can hardly be anything else). Notice that the entire
ﬁrst syllable (or-) is reduplicated in the perfect: By reduplicating the conso-
nant following the stem-vowel as well as the stem-vowel itself, the awkward
form **o’´
ori¨
e is avoided; in or´
ori¨
e the reduplicated consonant r keeps the
augment and the initial vowel of the verbal stem comfortably apart. Well
and good – the only problem is that after writing down the form or´
ori¨
e,
Tolkien struck it out! Whether this means that we are back on square one,
or whether Tolkien struck out the form or´
ori¨
e not because he invalidated
it but simply because he didn’t feel like discussing the perfect tense of ora-
there and then, none can say.
Since it is rather unclear how we should add the augment to most verbs
beginning in a vowel, I have simply avoided the perfect tense of such verbs
in the exercises I made for this course. But since augmentless perfects seem
to be permissible, the easiest solution must be to simply omit the augment
in the case of such verbs: anta- “give” becoming anti¨
e “has given”, onot-
“count up” becoming on´
oti¨
e “has counted up” (though this is also the
132


perfect of not- “reckon”!), and so on. After the rejected form or´
ori¨
e, Tolkien
actually wrote ori¨
e. Was this a replacement perfect tense, with no augment?
I would expect ´
ori¨
e with a lengthened stem-vowel; ori¨
e looks more like a
quite diﬀerent form of the verb (a gerund, to be discussed in later lessons).
This word may be worth noticing, all the same.
Before leaving the perfect tense, I should brieﬂy comment on a somewhat
strange form occurring in the Silmarillion, chapter 20. Here we have the
exclamation ut´
ulie’n aur¨
e, translated “the day has come”. Ut´
ulie (ut´
uli¨
e)
is clearly the perfect tense of tul- “come”, as conﬁrmed by the translation
“has come”. However, the added ’n is something of a mystery. What is this
extra consonant doing there? The form ut´
ulie’n is reminiscent of ut´
ulien
“I am come” in Elendil’s Declaration in LotR, but here -n is a pronominal
ending “I” (see the next section). No such ending can be present in ut´
ulie’n,
given Tolkien’s translation. The apostrophe ’ inserted before this latter n
probably indicates a diﬀerent pronunciation as well; in ut´
ulie’n the ﬁnal
consonant is perhaps meant to be sounded as a separate syllable. It may be
that this n is added simply for the sake of euphony, preventing three vowels
in sequence (since the next word also begins in a vowel; if you count the
diphthong au in aur¨
e as two vowels, there would even be four sequential
vowels). If a perfect tense appears with no secondary ending added to -
i¨
e, and the next word begins in a vowel, should we always insert ’n to
avoid too many vowels in hiatus? I have used such a system in at least one
composition of my own, but this conclusion is extremely tentative: In the
exercises below I have never used this extra ’n, since no one really knows
its function. Some even think it represents an alternative incarnation of
the article (which normally appears as i): After all, Tolkien did employ the
translation “the day has come”. Hence ut´
ulie’n aur¨
e = ?ut´
uli¨
e en aur¨
e
or ?ut´
uli¨
e in aur¨
e “has-come the day”??? (For a possible attestation of in
as a Quenya article, see PM:395.) We can only hope that future publications
will shed some more light on this. It may be noted that Christopher Gilson,
who has access to unpublished Tolkien material, advocates the ’n = “the”
interpretation.
8.2
Pronouns
It is time to introduce one of really economic devices of Language, the pro-
nouns. (If you know perfectly well what a pronoun is, and you also know
about the three diﬀerent “persons” that personal pronouns are divided into,
please scroll down until you see the word Quenya in red. I’m not trying to
waste anyone’s time here!)
The word “pronoun” is a giveaway; it simply means “for (instead of)
a noun”. Pronouns are words (or endings) that can replace a noun, often
referring back to a noun that has already been mentioned. Thus you don’t
133


have to repeat the noun itself all the time. Pronouns provide a kind of spoken
shorthand, saving the language from utter tedium. Thanks to pronouns,
speakers of English can keep up a conversation with another people without
having to endlessly repeat the other party’s name every time they are being
addressed; instead the pronoun you is substituted. Instead of having to
say “the group just referred to” or “the people presently being discussed”
speakers of English have at their disposal the short, snappy word they. And
try to imagine how you would go about referring to yourself without the
pronoun I. Phrases like “this person” or “the one who is talking now” get
tedious really fast.
There are several kinds of pronouns (even interrogative ones like “who”),
but the ones most frequently found are the personal pronouns, which we
will focus on in this introduction. Customarily, they are divided into three
diﬀerent “persons” (not that the pronouns involved only refer to sentient
beings; in this context, “person” is just an established term for a pronoun
class). In English, this traditional tripartite classiﬁcation produces a table
something like this:
• First person (referring to oneself or one’s own group): Singular I,
as object me, of ownership my and mine; plural we, as object us, of
ownership our and ours.
• Second person (directly addressing another person or another group):
Singular and plural both you, which is also the object form; of own-
ership your and yours. Archaic English also has distinct singular pro-
nouns: Thou, as object thee, of ownership thy and thine.
• Third person (referring to another person or group): Singular he,
she, or it depending on the gender and/or nature of what is being
referred to; as object him, her, or it (the latter being the same as the
subject form), of ownership his, her (the latter happens to coincide
with the object form, but there is also hers) and its. In the plural we
have they, as object them, of ownership their and theirs.
While the concept of these three “persons” as such is near-universal in the
languages of the world, it is quite arbitrary what other distinctions languages
build into their pronoun tables. The system is not necessarily symmetric,
either – certainly not so in English. English pronouns normally maintain
a distinction of singular vs. plural, e.g. singular I vs. plural we, but this
distinction is suddenly abandoned in the second person, where you is used
no matter whether the speaker addresses one person or several people. On
the other hand, English suddenly becomes very pedantic in the third person
singular. Here you have to use he if you are referring to a male, she if you
are referring to a female (or a ship!), and it if you are referring to something
inanimate or abstract, or to an animal (unless “it” is a pet and you feel
134


you know “it” so intimately that you must consider saying “he” or “she”
instead!)
Such hair-splitting distinctions are not made anywhere else in the En-
glish pronominal system, and certain other languages dispense with them.
Finnish, ever relevant for this study since it was Tolkien’s foremost inspi-
ration for Quenya, only has a single word (h¨
an) that covers both “he” and
“she”: The Finns get happily along without making this distinction. On the
other hand, other languages may go even further than English. For instance,
the Hebrews apparently thought the masculine/feminine distinction was so
interesting that it wasn’t enough to have separate words for “he” and “she”.
Hebrew also has separate words for “you” (atta when speaking to a man, att
when addressing a woman); the language even carries the principle into the
plural by having separate words for “they” (hem when referring to a group
of men, but with reference to an all-female group, “they” is henna. . . as I
understand it, a mixed group is referred to by the “masculine” term hem,
and then we are left to wonder if a group of 10,000 women and 1 man is still
hem rather than henna).
What, then, about Quenya? What pronominal distinctions did Tolkien
have his Elves make?
It is somewhat diﬃcult to say anything very deﬁnite about the Quenya
pronominal system. Even now, with enormous amounts of material still
unavailable to scholarship, it is already safe to say that the pronouns of
Tolkien’s Elvish languages were rather “unstable” – probably even more so
than many other aspects of his ever-ﬂuid linguistic constructs. The pronoun
tables seem to have undergone countless revisions, and some think Tolkien
never quite managed to sort out every detail. (Personally I think he did –
the problem is rather that he did it so often!)
We know that the Quenya pronominal system, as Tolkien envisioned it
in his later years, makes some distinctions that are not regularly expressed
in English. For one thing, just as Quenya has a dual form of the noun in
addition to the singular and plural forms, so there are also at least some dual
pronouns. So in the First Person we don’t ﬁnd singular “I” and plural “we”
only, but also a distinct dual pronoun meaning “you (sg.) and I” or “the two
of us”. Another subtle distinction is made in the words for “we”: In Quenya,
there are separate words or endings for “we”, depending on whether or not
the party that is addressed is included in “we” or not. On the other hand, it
seems that Quenya does not always maintain the distinction between “he”,
“she” and even “it”; all of these may be covered by a single pronoun.
As this course proceeds, we will discuss various parts of the pronoun table
and their associated obscurities, and also return to the special pronominal
distinctions made in Quenya. However, let us introduce a few pronouns right
away.
One thing should be understood: in Quenya, pronouns typically appear
as endings, not so often as independent words. (Where a Quenya pronoun
135


does appear as a separate word, it is often emphatic – producing much the
same eﬀect as putting an English pronoun in italics: “You [and no one else]
did it.” We will return to the independent pronouns later.) In the ﬁnal lines
of Nam´
ari¨
e we ﬁnd the word hiruvaly¨
e, translated “thou shalt ﬁnd” by
Tolkien. If you have worked your way through all the exercises, you will
remember the form hiruva, future tense of hir- “ﬁnd”. This hiruva “shall
ﬁnd” here appears with the pronominal ending -ly¨
e attached, denoting the
subject of the verb. This ending belongs to the Second Person and signiﬁes
“thou” – or using a less archaic translation, “you”. Hence hiruvaly¨
e =
“thou shalt ﬁnd”, or “you will ﬁnd”. The suﬃx -ly¨
e can be attached to any
verb to indicate that its subject is “you, thou”.
Having mentioned this pronoun we however run into Instant Obscurity,
which is a situation we shall often ﬁnd ourselves in while discussing Quenya
pronouns. It is unclear whether or not this ending -ly¨
e covers both singular
and plural “you”; in Nam´
ari¨
e it is singular, as demonstrated by the trans-
lation “thou”. In one of Tolkien’s draft texts for the LotR Appendices, he
actually wrote that the Elvish languages did not distinguish between sin-
gular and plural “you” (no more than English does): “All these languages
. . . had, or originally had, no distinction between the singular and plural
of the second person pronouns; but they had a marked distinction between
the familiar forms and the courteous” (PM:42–43). The ending -ly¨
e, used
by Galadriel to address a relative stranger like Frodo, would seem to be a
polite or courteous “you”. In Nam´
ari¨
e it is thus used as a singular “thou”,
only one person being addressed, but according to PM:42–43 just quoted it
could equally well be plural “you” (so if all the members of the Fellowship
had understood Quenya, they still couldn’t be certain whether Galadriel was
addressing them all, or Frodo alone).
However, in the essay Quendi and Eldar written about half a decade after
the publication of LotR, Tolkien did imply the existence of pronominal end-
ings that make a distinction between singular and plural “you” (WJ:364).
Here he referred to “reduced pronominal aﬃxes of the 2nd person”, implied
to be -t in the singular and -l in the plural. This -l could well be a “re-
duced” form of -ly¨
e, which would then be a plural “you”. Even so, Tolkien
indisputably used this ending for a singular “you” in Nam´
ari¨
e, since he
translated it as “thou” in the text in LotR. This shorter ending -l is also
attested as part of the verb hamil “you judge” (VT42:33), and this may
also be taken as a singular “you”, though the context is not conclusive either
way. It would seem that in the second half of the ﬁfties, Tolkien had been
rethinking the pronominal system. The statement made in the draft text
for the LotR Appendices, to the eﬀect that Elvish did not distinguish sin-
gular and plural “you”, had not actually made it into the published LotR.
Therefore he would not be bound by it. (Whenever we are dealing with
Tolkien material that has been published only posthumously, we can never
be certain that the information provided is entirely “canonical”: The author
136


could always change his mind, and so he often did, especially regarding the
languages.)
Tolkien had apparently discovered that Quenya possesses distinct pro-
nouns for singular and plural “you” after all. Perhaps the new (ca. 1960)
idea goes something like this: -ly¨
e and the shorter variant -l would properly
be a plural “you”, but it is also used as a polite singular, hence the trans-
lation “thou” in Nam´
ari¨
e. The idea of addressing a single person as if (s)he
were several people could be a way of showing respect, emphasizing the im-
portance of the other. Parallels are found in languages of our own world.
(A former British PM on occasion carried this system over from the Second
Person to the First, referring to herself as a plural “we” rather than a singu-
lar “I”, apparently to emphasize her own importance. Of course, royals have
been using this linguistic device for centuries – and for that matter, even
the author of this course sometimes refers to himself as “we”! But actually
I tend to include the reader in this “we”, so that you quite undeservedly re-
ceive some of the credit for the gradual unraveling of Quenya grammar that
“we” are undertaking here. . . ) As for English “thou” vs. “you”, Matthew
Skala wrote on the Elﬂing list (January 4, 2001):
”Thou” is second person singular, and “you” is second person
plural, with the added rule that in formal contexts it’s polite to
use plural even when talking to an individual. Much like French
“tu” (singular/informal) and “vous” (plural/formal). In English
it has become standard to use “you” for both singular and plural
regardless of politeness, but that is a recent innovation; until
about 100–200 years ago, English speakers routinely used “thou”
in informal contexts. The bizarre situation today is that because
of this historical change, most of us only ever encounter “thou”
in historical and formal contexts, such as the Bible. . . and so
now, if you use it you sound like you’re being especially formal
and polite. The “formality/politeness” charge has been ﬂipped
backwards.
It may be, then, that Quenya -ly¨
e or -l corresponds to the original use of
English “you”, before the historical change Skala describes – but because of
that change, -l(y¨
e) used as a polite singular may now be rendered “thou”,
as Tolkien translated it in LotR.
To summarize: the ending -l(y¨
e) can certainly be used as a singular “you”,
and it is probably a polite/courteous form rather than a familiar/intimate
form. It may be that -l(y¨
e) also covers plural “you”, this may even be
its proper meaning, but this is where things get somewhat obscure. Tolkien
probably changed his mind back and forth about the details. In the exercises
below, I have simply used the neutral word “you” as the equivalent of -l(y¨
e).
Then it is impossible to go wrong.
137


But we seem to have plunged right into the Second Person; let us return
to the First. In the First Person singular, things are luckily crystal clear
(well, very nearly so). The pronoun “I” is most often represented by the
ending -n. (Linguists have noted that in the languages of the world, the
term for “I, me” remarkably often includes some nasal sound like N or M.
Whatever subtle features of human psychology underlie this phenomenon,
Tolkien seems to have liked this association, and worked it into several of
his languages. Cf. Sindarin im = “I”.) Notice how the ending -n is added to
the verbs ut´
uli¨
e (perfect tense of tul- “come”) and maruva (future tense
of mar- “abide, dwell”) in Elendil’s Declaration:
Et E¨
arello Endorenna ut´
ulien = “out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth
I am come.”
Sinom¨
e maruvan = “in this place will I abide”.
However, the ending -n for “I” also occurs as a longer variant, -ny¨
e. (As
noted above, the ending -ly¨
e for “you” has a shorter variant -l; the variation
-ny¨
e vs. -n for “you” would parallel this.) This longer variant is seen in a
word we have already touched on in this lesson, the form ut´
uvienyes! “I
have found it!” – Aragorn’s exclamation when he found the discovered the
sapling of the White Tree. The word ut´
uvi¨
e, apparently the perfect tense
of a verb tuv- “ﬁnd”, here occurs with two pronominal endings. The ﬁrst
of them, -ny¨
e or “I”, denotes the subject of the verb: Ut´
uvie+ny¨
e “have
found+I” = “I have found”. However, following -ny¨
e we have yet another
pronominal ending, the Third Person Singular suﬃx -s, meaning “it”. Thus
an entire sentence of verb, subject and object has been telescoped into a
single word: ut´
uvienyes = “I have found it”.
NOTE: Notice that according to the spelling conventions here employed, ﬁnal -¨
e loses
its diaeresis whenever an ending is added so that it is not ﬁnal anymore: ut´
uvi¨
e + -ny¨
e =
ut´
uvieny¨
e and not ut´
uvi¨
eny¨
e; adding -s to ut´
uvieny¨
e likewise produces ut´
uvienyes
and not ut´
uvieny¨
es. This is solely a matter of orthography.
We can abstract this grammatical rule: if a verb is to receive two pronom-
inal endings, one denoting the subject of the verb and the second the object,
the subject ending is attached ﬁrst and the object ending next. In published
material, there are two or three other examples of this, beside ut´
uvienyes.
It is then obvious why the long form -nye- is preferred here. While ut´
uv-
ien would do nicely for “I have found”, the object ending -s “it” could not
have been added to the short ending -n, since **ut´
uviens is not a possible
Quenya word. So we can formulate another rule: The long form -ny¨
e (-nye-),
NOT short -n, must be used for “I” if another pronominal ending is to follow
it. (Similarly, for “you” one must use the long ending -ly¨
e [-lye-], not the
shorter form -l, if a second pronominal ending is to be added: “You have
found” could be either ut´
uviel or ut´
uviely¨
e, but “you have found it” must
be ut´
uvielyes, since **ut´
uviels would be impossible.)
The long ending -ny¨
e “I” may however occur even if there is no ob-
138


ject pronoun following it (as can the long form -ly¨
e for “you, thou”, cf.
hiruvaly¨
e “thou shalt ﬁnd” in Nam´
ari¨
e). The form linduvany¨
e “I shall
sing” occurs on the frontispiece of the 1975 French bilingual edition of The
Adventures of Tom Bombadil (ISBN 2-264-00913-6). The frontispiece repro-
duces a manuscript page by Tolkien, including some brief linguistic notes.
(Taum Santoski, analyzing these notes in the newsletter Beyond Bree, Oc-
tober 1985, read this form as “linduvanya” – but as pointed out by Carl
F. Hostetter, Tolkien probably intended “linduvanye” instead. Tolkien was
capable of wonderful calligraphy, but his normal handwriting is often a chal-
lenge to transcribers!) As long as no second pronominal ending is to follow,
it is apparently wholly optional whether one uses the long ending -ny¨
e or
the short ending -n for “I”. We have the long ending in linduvany¨
e “I shall
sing”, but Elendil’s Declaration uses the short ending in maruvan “I will
abide”. Certainly these examples could be scrambled to produce linduvan,
maruvany¨
e of exactly the same meaning.
It seems, however, that the short ending -n is much more common than
the longer suﬃx -ny¨
e. We have already encountered this -n attached to
several verbs, such as polin “I can”, tirin “I watch” in the previous lesson.
Tolkien very often cites primary verbs like this, listing them as they appear
in the 1st person aorist (with the ending -i- intact because it is followed
by an ending and hence not ﬁnal, so that it would become -¨
e). Tirin is an
example actually found in the Etymologies (entry tir), but by the standards
of this ﬁeld, examples truly abound: carin “I make, build” (entry kar), lirin
“I sing” (glir) or “I chant” (lir1), nutin “I tie” (nut), nyarin “I tell”
(nar2), rerin “I sow” (red), serin “I rest” (sed), sucin “I drink” (suk),
tamin “I tap” (tam), tucin “I draw” (tuk), tulin “I come” (tul), turin
“I wield” (tur), tyavin “I taste” (kyap), vilin “I ﬂy” (wil), umin “I
do not” (ugu/umu). The form polin “I can” (VT41:6) is one of several
examples from post-LotR sources. Presumably it would in no way be wrong
to use the long ending -ny¨
e instead (e.g. poliny¨
e), but -n is the commonest
ending in the published corpus. But especially for the purpose of poetry, it is
often practical to be able to choose between a long and a short pronominal
ending, so that one can include or get rid of a syllable if the meter demands
this.
Also notice that the ending -ny¨
e, as well as -ly¨
e for “you”, cause the
accent to fall on the syllable preceding the ending because ny and ly here
count as consonant clusters. Cf. the stress rules set out in Lesson One. If
hiruvany¨
e “I will ﬁnd” (with the accent on a) doesn’t sound good in your
poem, you can always use the short form hiruvan and have the accent land
on i in the ﬁrst syllable instead. (Again, we may have the same system in
the Second Person: It is entirely possible that in Nam´
ari¨
e, Tolkien wrote
hiruvaly¨
e rather than the shorter form hiruval simply because the former
variant ﬁt his poetic meter better.)
As for the ending -s meaning “it”, occurring as an object pronoun in
139


ut´
uvienyes “I have found it”, it seems that it may also be used as a subject.
For instance, if polin is “I can”, we must assume that “it can” would be
polis. However, the ending -s brings us into the Third Person with its own
set of obscurities, which we will save for later (Lesson 15). In the exercises
below, -s is used in the same way as in the example ut´
uvienyes: attached
to another pronominal ending to denote the object of the verb (just as the
ﬁrst ending added to the verb denotes its subject).
Summary of Lesson Eight
The Quenya perfect tense is formed by adding the ending -i¨
e to the verbal
stem (if the stem ends in a vowel, it is apparently omitted before -i¨
e is added;
verbs in -ya seem to loose this entire ending). Unless followed by a consonant
cluster, the stem-vowel is lengthened. Normally it is also reduplicated as an
augment preﬁxed to the verb (ric- “twist” vs. ir´
ıci¨
e “has twisted”, hanya-
“understand” vs. ah´
ani¨
e “has understood”). However, there also appear
some unaugmented perfects in the published corpus (notably f´
ıri¨
e rather
than if´
ıri¨
e for “has expired”), so it may be permissible to leave out the
augment and still have a valid perfect tense form. It is somewhat unclear
how the augment is to be preﬁxed to verbal stems beginning in a vowel.
– Quenya pronouns most typically appear as endings rather than separate
words. Among these pronominal endings we have -n or -ny¨
e “I”, -l or -ly¨
e
“thou, you” and -s “it”. Two pronominal endings may be added to the same
verb, the ﬁrst of them denoting the subject of the verb, the second its object.

Lesson 9
The inﬁnitive. The negative verb. Active participles.
9.1
The inﬁnitive
All of the forms of the verb that we have discussed so far, all the tenses, are
what a linguist would call ﬁnite verb forms. The deﬁnition of a ﬁnite verb
is that it is capable of functioning as the predicate of a sentence, the part
of the sentence that tells us what the subject does (or is – in Lesson Four
we pointed out that a phrase made up of copula + noun or adjective also
counts as a predicate, e.g. “gold is beautiful”, but here we will deal with
more normal verbs instead). In a sentence like i Elda m´
ata massa “the
Elf is eating bread”, linguists can readily label the roles of all parts of the
sentence: just like i Elda “the Elf” is the subject and massa “bread” is the
object, so the verb m´
ata “is eating” is the predicate of the sentence. And
precisely because the form m´
ata, present tense of mat- “eat”, is able to
function as a predicate here, we can tell that m´
ata is a ﬁnite form of the
verb.
The inﬁnitive is another story. It is, as the name suggests, in-ﬁnite –
non-ﬁnite. It is not inﬂected for time, as are the tenses. It does not receive
the ending -r, even if the subject of the sentence is plural. So by itself, an
inﬁnitive is not capable of functioning as the predicate of a sentence. An
inﬁnitive cannot be directly teamed up with a subject. What, then, is its
use?
English inﬁnitives have various uses, but an important function of the
inﬁnitive is that it allows several verbs to be combined in one sentence. In
a sentence like “the Dwarves wanted to eat”, the verb “wanted” is a ﬁnite
form, appearing in one speciﬁc tense (in this case past tense). But the verb
“eat” appears as an inﬁnitive, “to eat”, complementing the ﬁnite verb to
form a longer verbal phrase “wanted to eat”. In English, inﬁnitive verbs are
very often marked by inserting “to” before the verb proper, but this “to” is
not always included. In a sentence like “I let him go”, the verb “go” counts
as an inﬁnitive even though there is no “to” before it. (Contrast “I allowed
him to go”.) Neither is “to” included before an inﬁnitive following certain
142


verbs like “can” or “must” (e.g. “I must go”, not **“I must to go”).
In Quenya, there seems to be no independent inﬁnitive marker like English
“to”, so we don’t have to worry about where to include or omit it. Attested
examples of Quenya inﬁnitives most certainly do not abound, but there is
the sentence polin quet¨
e “I can speak” (VT41:6). Here the verb polin “I
can” is a ﬁnite form, the aorist of the primary verb pol- appearing with the
pronominal ending -n “I” attached – but the word quet¨
e must be analyzed
as an inﬁnitive. Of course, quet¨
e is similar in form to an aorist “speaks”,
but as indicated by the translation “speak” as well as the context, the form
quet¨
e is inﬁnitival here. We can tell, then, that primary verbs like quet-
have inﬁnitives in -¨
e (undoubtedly representing Primitive Elvish -i). The
ending may be analyzed simply as a kind of stopgap that is supplied to make
up for the absence of any other ending, or quet¨
e may be seen as representing
an uninﬂected primitive “I-stem” kweti. No matter how we imagine the
ultimate derivation and the “meaning” of the ending -¨
e, we probably know
enough to actually start using the inﬁnitive form of primary verbs. Here are
some (home-made) examples combining inﬁnitives with various ﬁnite forms
(tenses) of the verbs mer- “wish, want” and pol- “can”. Finite verbs in red,
inﬁnitives in blue:
I Elda pol¨
e cen¨
e i Nauco “the Elf can see the Dwarf” (notice that though
the verbs pol- “want” and cen- “see, behold” receive the same ending -¨
e here, the former
is an aorist and the latter is an inﬁnitive: The context must decide whether the form cen¨
e
is to be understood as an aorist “sees” or an inﬁnitive “[to] see”)
I Naucor merner mat¨
e ”the Dwarves wanted to eat” (ﬁnite verb merner
“wanted”, inﬂected for past tense and plural, + inﬁnitive verb mat¨
e “to eat”)
I seldo poll¨
e hlar¨
e ilya quetta “the boy could hear every word”
Polily¨
e car¨
e ilqua “you can do everything”
I nissi meruvar tul¨
e “the women will want to come”
What, then, about A-stems? In the Etymologies, Tolkien often glossed A-
stem verbs as if they were inﬁnitives, e.g. anta- “to present, give”, varya-
“to protect” or yelta- “to loathe” (entries ana1, bar, dyel). This is not
by itself conclusive evidence that a form like anta could actually be used
as an inﬁnitive “to give” in a Quenya text, for in the tradition of Western
linguistics, the inﬁnitive is commonly the form used to name, list or gloss
a verb in wordlists. Sometimes this system is carried through even where
such a gloss is strictly wrong: A Hebrew-English wordlist may insist that
nathan means “to give”, though it actually means “he gave” – this being
the simplest and most basic form of this verb, the logical form to be listed
in a dictionary. However, a form like anta- is simply an uninﬂected A-stem,
and Tolkien did refer to certain grammatical circumstances “when the bare
stem of the verb is used . . . as inﬁnitive” (MC:223). The general system also
seems to suggest that A-stems with no additions can function as inﬁnitives.
(Notice that the inﬁnitives of both primary verbs and A-stems seem to be
143


similar in form to ending-less aorists.) So I guess we can have sentences like
the following (and let me just underline the inﬁnitives to avoid too much
fancy coloring):
I vendi merner linda “the maidens wanted to sing”
I norsa pol¨
e orta i alta ondo “the giant can lift the big rock”
Merin cenda i parma “I want to read the book”
In some cases, English may prefer a form in -ing to a regular inﬁnitive,
for instance after the verbs “start” and “stop”. I think it is a fair guess that
Quenya would use the normal inﬁnitive in such cases as well:
I nissi pustaner linda “the women stopped singing” (or, “. . . ceased
to sing”)
Several inﬁnitives can probably be juxtaposed by means of ar “and”:
I neri merir cenda ar tec¨
e rimb¨
e parmar “the men want to read and
(to) write many books”
The discussion above certainly does not cover all there is to say about
Quenya inﬁnitives. Some more details are known and will be ﬁlled in later in
this course, but there are many obscure points. In some very late (ca. 1969)
notes, Tolkien refers to “the general (aorist) ‘inﬁnitive’ formed by added
-i” (VT41:17), but since only brief quotes from this material have been
published, we cannot be certain what he means. Is there a speciﬁc “aorist
inﬁnitive”? We have earlier discussed the distinction made between such
forms as m´
ata “is eating” (present/continuative tense) and mat¨
e “eats”
(aorist). Does Quenya carry these distinctions over into the inﬁnitive, so
that one can somehow distinguish “to eat” (aorist inﬁnitive) from “to be
eating” (continuative inﬁnitive)?
Moreover, what does Tolkien refer to by “added -i”? Obviously there is an
inﬁnitive that is formed by adding -i to the verbal stem (of primary verbs at
least). But is this ending a contemporary Quenya suﬃx, or does it represent
a Primitive Elvish form? As mentioned above, the attested inﬁnitive quet¨
e
“(to) say” may be meant to represent a primitive form kweti, which would
indeed be the root kwet- with “added -i”. But if this -i is a contemporary
Quenya suﬃx, there would be an alternative inﬁnitive queti “to say”. How
it is used, and whether it is interchangeable with the attested form quet¨
e,
we cannot even begin to guess. In the essay Quendi and Eldar, Tolkien did
mention a few verb forms that may seem to exemplify an inﬁnitive in -i,
namely auciri and h´
ociri, both meaning “cut oﬀ” (in two diﬀerent senses,
see WJ:365–366). But later in the essay, he quoted the same forms with a
hyphen attached (auciri-, h´
ociri-), as if these are verbal stems rather than
independent inﬁnitive forms (WJ:368). So we cannot be sure of anything,
and must await the publication of more material.
As noted above, the inﬁnitive is traditionally used to name or list verbs,
or to give their meaning as a general gloss. From now on we will often
144


deﬁne verbs in such a way, e.g. glossing a verbal stem like tul- as “to come”
and lanta- as “to fall” (rather than simply “come”, “fall”). It must still be
understood that the mere stem of primary verb like tul- cannot function as
an actual inﬁnitive (“tul”) in a Quenya text (it must be tul¨
e instead). It is
simply customary and convenient to give the meaning of a verb by quoting
its gloss in the inﬁnitive. In the Vocabulary listings of Lessons 5 through
8, I had to write “verb” in front of the gloss of every new verb to make it
crystal clear what part of speech the new word belonged to. Sometimes this
was actually necessary: If I deﬁned lanta- simply as “fall”, some student
would surely manage to overlook the ﬁnal hyphen of lanta- that is meant
to suggest that this is a verbal stem, and conclude that “fall” is here a noun
– autumn, or something! Finally having introduced the inﬁnitive, I will use
this form instead when glossing verbs – like “to fall” in this case.
NOTE 1: In English, inﬁnitives introduced by “to” (or “in order to”) are often used to
describe an intention: “I came to see you.” In such a context, it seems that Quenya does
not use the forms discussed so far, but a quite diﬀerent construction (gerund in dative, to
be discussed in a later lesson).
9.2
The negative verb
This may be a good place to introduce a somewhat peculiar Quenya verb.
Earlier we have mentioned the copula n´
a “is”, which we can now refer to as
a tense of the verb “to be”. (Don’t ask me if n´
a is the present tense or the
aorist, and the other tenses of this verb are unfortunately even more obscure:
The verb “to be” is notoriously irregular in the languages of the world, and
Tolkien may well have invented some nice irregularities for Quenya as well.)
Anyhow, Quenya also has a unitary verb meaning “not to be”; you can
express this meaning without combining some form of n´
a with a separate
word for “not” (though Quenya does have such a negation as well). This verb
is listed in the Etymologies, entry ugu/umu, where it appears as umin “I am
not” (another example of Tolkien’s frequent habit of listing primary verbs
in the 1st person aorist). The past tense is also listed, somewhat irregular:
it is ´
um¨
e, not **umn¨
e as it would have to be according to the simplest
“regular” pattern. ´
Um¨
e as the past tense of a primary verb um- would
seem to belong to the same pattern as l´
av¨
e, pa.t. of lav- “to lick” (cf.
undul´
av¨
e “down-licked” = “covered” in Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR). One must take
care not to confuse the past tense form ´
um¨
e “was not” with the ending-less
aorist um¨
e “is not”.
As the future tense of this verb, we might expect umuva, and this unat-
tested form may well be permissible – but actually a shorter form ´
uva
occurs in F´
ıriel’s Song. Here we have the phrase ´
uva . . . far¨
ea, “will not
be enough” (far¨
ea = adjective “enough, suﬃcient”). Possibly, this ´
uva is
actually the future tense of another verb: Besides umin “I am not” from the
145


root umu Tolkien also listed a form uin of the same meaning – apparently
derived from the root ugu. Perhaps ´
uva is strictly the future tense of the
latter verb. It could represent a primitive form something like uguba, whereas
uin is to be derived from ugin (or ugi-ni at an even older stage). Between
vowels, g was lost in Quenya, so that the two u’s of uguba merged into one
long ´
u in ´
uva, whereas the u and the i of ugin merged into a diphthong ui
(as in uin) when the disappearance of g brought the two vowels into direct
contact. Whatever development Tolkien may have imagined, we will here
use ´
uva as the future tense of um- “not to be”, avoiding the unattested
(and perhaps somewhat awkward) form umuva.
Like n´
a, this “negative copula” can presumably be used to connect a
subject with a noun or an adjective:
I Nauco um¨
e aran “the Dwarf is not a king”
I nissi umir tiuc¨
e “the women are not fat”
I rocco ´
um¨
e mor¨
e “the horse was not black”
I neri ´
umer sail¨
e “the men were not wise”
Elda ´
uva ´
um¨
ea “an Elf will not be evil”
Nissi ´
uvar ohtari “women will not be warriors” (sorry, ´
Eowyn!)
Or, using pronominal endings instead of an independent subject:
Umin Elda “I am not an Elf”
´
Umen saila “I was not wise”
´
Uvaly¨
e ohtar “you will not be a warrior”
But above I said that this was a good place to introduce the negative verb.
This is because it can probably be combined with inﬁnitives as well. We lack
actual examples, but in the entry ugu/umu in Etym, Tolkien indicated that
umin does not always signify “I am not”. It can just as well mean “I do
not”. By combining such a verb with an inﬁnitive, one can probably negate
the verbs in question. Home-made examples involving various tenses of the
negative verb:
Umin tur¨
e macil “I do not wield a sword”
M´
ama um¨
e mat¨
e hr´
av¨
e “a sheep does not eat ﬂesh”
I Nauco ´
um¨
e tul¨
e “the Dwarf did not come”
I neri ´
umer hir¨
e i harma “the men did not ﬁnd the treasure”
I n´
ıs ´
uva linda “the woman will not sing”
I neri ´
uvar cen¨
e i Elda “the men will not see the Elf”
We must assume that following the negative verb, as well as in other
contexts, several inﬁnitives may sometimes be combined, like mer¨
e and
cen¨
e in this sentence (the ﬁnite verb in red, the two inﬁnitives in blue and
pink):
I Elda ´
um¨
e mer¨
e cen¨
e i Nauco. “The Elf did not want to see the
Dwarf.”
146


Or again, with the inﬁnitives mer¨
e and cenda:
I Nauco ´
uva mer¨
e cenda i parma. “The Dwarf will not want to read
the book.”
Presumably the present/continuous tense of the negative verb, which
would have to be ´
uma, can be used to deny the existence of an ongoing
action:
I Nauco ´
uma linda “the Dwarf is not singing” (just now)
Contrast the aorist: I Nauco um¨
e linda “the Dwarf does not sing”. The
latter would often (but not necessarily) have a wider application, like “the
Dwarf is not a singer”. Anyhow, we will stick to the aorist in the exercises
below.
9.3
Active participles
The various parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives, remain
relatively distinct categories most of the time. However, some words fuse
the properties of several parts of speech. The participles are words with a
basically adjectival function, but they are directly derived from verbs, and
in the case of active participles, they are still able to take an object.
The participles are subdivided into two categories, often called present
participles and past participles. These terms are somewhat misleading, for
the most important distinction between has nothing to do with tenses. The
alternative terms active participles and passive participles are better, and I
will try to use them consistently here.
We will save the “past” or passive participle for the next lesson and focus
on the “present” or active participles here. In English, this form is derived
by means of the ending -ing. For instance, the verb “follow” has the active
participle “following”. This verbal adjective describes the state of something
or someone that carries out the action of the corresponding verb: The day
that follows can be described as the following day.
If the verb is able to take an object, so is its corresponding participle. A
person who loves Elves can be described as a person loving Elves.
In English, the form derived from verbs by adding -ing is somewhat am-
biguous. It can also function as a noun. The active participle of a verb like
“kill” is of course killing, as it is clearly adjectival in a phrase like “a killing
experience”, but in a sentence like “the killing must stop”, it is equally clear
that it is used as a noun. But in the latter sentence, “killing” is a verbal noun,
an abstract noun denoting the action of killing. Here we are only interested
in verbal adjectives = participles. In Quenya, the two do not coincide in
form.
The Quenya ending corresponding to English -ing (when used to form
participles) is -la. There are many examples of active participles in the
147


Markirya poem. For instance, Tolkien in his annotation indicated that “ilkala
[is the] participle of ilka ‘gleam (white)’” (MC:223). The participle ilcala
(as we would spell it here) thus means “gleaming”, and so it is used in the
poem, in a phrase translated “in the moon gleaming” (MC:215).
It seems that in a Quenya active participle, the stem-vowel is lengthened
if possible. In ilcala the i cannot become long ´
ı because there is a conso-
nant cluster following it. However, Tolkien in MC:223 also mentioned a verb
hlapu- “to ﬂy or stream in the wind” (one of the rare U-stems, a rather
obscure category of verbs). Its participle appears as hl´
apula on the previous
page: Winga hl´
apula, translated “foam blowing” (cf. MC:214). We must
assume, then, that the participle of a verb like lala- “to laugh” is l´
alala
(!) “laughing”: The stem-vowel is lengthened. If the verbal stem includes a
vowel that is long already, it simply stays long in the participle: The partici-
ples of p´
ıca- “to lessen, dwindle” and r´
uma- “to shift, move, heave” appear
as p´
ıcala and r´
umala in the Markirya poem.
In the case of longer verbal stems where the stem-vowel occurs twice, as
in falasta- “to foam” (root evidently phalas), it seems that it is the second
occurrence of the stem-vowel that is to be lengthened if possible. In this
case it cannot be lengthened, since it is followed by a consonant cluster;
the participle “foaming” is attested (in Markirya) as falastala. The ﬁrst
occurrence of the stem-vowel could have been lengthened as far as phonology
is concerned (**f´
alastala), but this ﬁrst vowel evidently does not “count”
for the purpose of lengthening. (Presumably it is not lengthened in the
present tense, either: falast¨
ea “is foaming”, hardly ?f´
alast¨
ea, much less
**fal´
ast¨
ea.)
The primary verbs are a problem. Adding the ending -la to their stems
would usually result in consonant clusters not permitted in Quenya. For
instance, the participle of the verb tir- “to watch” cannot be **tirla (let
alone **t´
ırla), a quite impossible Quenya word. It has been assumed that in
such cases, one may start by constructing the “continuative stem” (similar to
the present tense) by lengthening the stem-vowel and adding -a, e.g. t´
ıra “is
watching”, and then derive the participle by adding the participial ending
-la to this form: t´
ırala “watching”. Markirya has h´
acala as a participle
“yawning”; unfortunately the underlying verb “to yawn” is not attested,
but if it is a primary verb hac-, the attested participial form would conﬁrm
such a theory. But of course, the verb underlying the participle h´
acala could
just as well be an A-stem haca- or h´
aca- (cf. hl´
apula “blowing, streaming”
from hlapu- and p´
ıcala “dwindling, waning” from p´
ıca-).
With the publication of The Peoples of Middle-earth in 1996, a form that
may seem to be the participle of a primary verb became available: PM:363
refers to the root “it [as in] itila ‘twinkling, glinting’, and ´
ıta ‘a ﬂash’, ita-
verb ‘to sparkle’.” But is itila really the participle of a primary verb it-?
Tolkien refers to it- as a “stem” or root (cf. PM:346), not as a Quenya verb.
The actual Quenya verb in question is listed as ita-, a short A-stem meaning
148


“to sparkle”. Its participle would presumably be´
ıtala, not itila. If the latter
is a participle at all, it is a peculiar one: it shows no lengthening of the stem-
vowel (not **´
ıtila), and a connecting vowel -i- is inserted before the ending
-la. Since the aorist of a verb it- would be iti- (becoming it¨
e only in the
absence of any endings), one may wonder if itila is an aorist participle. This
would mean that Quenya is able to carry the distinction of aorist/present
tense over into the participle, so that there are diﬀerent forms for “doing”
(habitually or momentarily) and “doing” (continuously): perhaps something
like carila and c´
arala, respectively (from the verb car- “to do”). But this
is speculative, and I cannot recommend such a system to writers; we must
await the publication of more material. It may be that itila is simply an old
adjectival formation that no longer “counts” as an adjective in Quenya. The
ending -la occurs in adjectives as well, e.g. saila “wise”; undoubtedly -la is
in origin simply an adjectival ending that came to be favoured as the suﬃx
used to derive verbal adjectives = participles.
Even so, Quenya participles seem to have established themselves as for-
mations quite distinct from adjectives, for in one respect their behaviour
diﬀers: Unlike adjectives, the active participles apparently do not agree in
number. For instance, Markirya has r´
amar sis´
ılala for “wings shining”
(the second word being the participle of the verb sis´
ıla-, a longer variant of
the verb sil- “shine white”). As we remember, normal adjectives in -a have
plural forms in -¨
e (representing archaic Quenya -ai). So if sis´
ılala were to
be agree in number with the noun it describes, we would have expected
**r´
amar sis´
ılal¨
e. Perhaps Tolkien did not want participles in -la to agree
in number precisely because the plural form of the participial ending would
have to be -l¨
e: This ending could easily be confused with the prominent
abstract ending -l¨
e, which is added to verbal stems to derive verbal nouns
– e.g. lindal¨
e “singing” from linda- “to sing” (as in Ainulindal¨
e “Ainu-
singing”, free rendering “Music of the Ainur”). While lindala and lindal¨
e
both translate as “singing” in English, the latter is a noun (“a singing”),
whereas the former is “singing” in the adjectival sense.
English very often employs the active participle to express the mean-
ing of a continuative tense, combining the participle with a copula like
“is” or “was”, e.g. “the boy is laughing”. But regarding present actions
at least, Quenya would rather express this meaning by using the genuine
present/continuative tense: I seldo l´
al¨
ea. None can say whether the Eng-
lish-style wording i seldo n´
a l´
alala is a valid Quenya sentence; one suspects
that while it would be intelligible, the Eldar (/Tolkien) would not think of
it as “good Quenya”.
While we have no attested example of an active participle taking an object,
we must assume that it is possible, e.g. Nauco t´
ırala Elda, “a Dwarf
watching an Elf”.

Summary of Lesson Nine
The inﬁnitive is a form of the verb that is not inﬂected for tense and is
therefore unable to function as the predicate of a sentence (as a ﬁnite verb
can); an inﬁnitive may be combined with other verbs to form longer verbal
phrases. While there are some obscurities, the (or one) Quenya inﬁnitive
is apparently identical to the verbal stem itself, except that primary verbs
receive the ending -¨
e – e.g. quet- “to speak” in the sentence polin quet¨
e “I
can speak”. This inﬁnitive would seem to be the one used when inﬁnite and
ﬁnite verbs are combined (as in the example just quoted, where the inﬁnitive
quet¨
e is combined with a ﬁnite form of the verb pol- “can”). – The negative
verb um- (past tense ´
um¨
e, future ´
uva) can apparently function both as a
negative copula (“not be”) and as a verb that may be combined with the
inﬁnitive of other verbs to express “not do. . . ” something, e.g. umin quet¨
e
“I do not speak”. – The active participle, a verbal adjective describing the
state of the one carrying out the action denoted by the corresponding verb,
is derived by adding -la to the corresponding verbal stem. The stem-vowel
is lengthened if there is no consonant cluster following it. It is somewhat
unclear how the ending -la is to be added to the stems of primary verbs,
but one plausible assumption may be that the ending is suﬃxed to the
“continuous” form (with lengthened stem-vowel and ending -a, e.g. t´
ıra
from tir- “to watch”, hence t´
ırala as the participle “watching”).

from prohibitions. For the two latter meanings, Quenya uses distinct words.)

Lesson 10
Adverbs. The pronominal endings -nt¨
e and -t. Inﬁnitives
with object pronouns. The past tense of intransitive verbs in
-ya. Passive participles.
10.1
Adverbs
Adverbs form a part of speech that is used to provide “extra information” in
a sentence. A typical sentence provides information about who does what (to
whom), involving a subject, a predicate and if necessary an object. But you
may also want to slip in information about when, where or in what manner
the verbal action occurs. This is where adverbs enter the linguistic stage.
In many cases, adverbs are to verbs what adjectives are to nouns. Like
an adjective may describe a noun, an adverb may describe the nature of the
verbal action of the sentence. In a sentence like “they left swiftly”, the last
word is an adverb describing how or in what manner “they left”. If we say
“she is singing now”, the word “now” is an adverb answering the question
of when the verbal action is taking place. And if we say “they did it here”,
the word “here” is an adverb telling us where the verbal action took place.
Some adverbs may be called “basic”, since they are not derived from an-
other part of speech. Just consider such an adverb of time as English “now”
and its Quenya equivalent s´
ı; neither can be further analyzed. But very
many English adverbs are not “basic” in this way. They are transparently
derived from adjectives, as in one of the examples we just used: The adverb
“swiftly” is obviously based on the adjective “swift”. The Great English
Adverb-Former is the ending -ly, which can in principle be added to any
adjective, turning it into an adverb (producing such pairs as deep/deeply,
ﬁnal/ﬁnally, great/greatly, high/highly, swift/swiftly and countless others. . .
but preferably not “good/goodly”, since the place of “goodly” is already oc-
cupied by the basic adverb well!) Since we have only a handful of words that
Tolkien explicitly identiﬁed as adverbs, but plenty of adjectives, it would be
nice if we could pin down a Quenya adverb-former like the English ending
-ly. Then we could derive our own Quenya adverbs.
We may have such a Quenya ending. It occurs in LotR, as part of the Cor-
152


mallen Praise (volume 3, Book Six, chapter IV: “The Field of Cormallen”).
As part of the praise received by the Ringbearers we have the two words
andav¨
e laituvalmet, translated “long we will praise them” in Letters:308.
Here we have the adverb andav¨
e, “long” (here meaning “for a long time”).
We know that the Quenya adjective “long” is anda (cf. Sindarin and as in
And+duin = Anduin, “Long River”). It would seem, then, that this adjective
has been turned into an adverb by supplying the ending -v¨
e (probably re-
lated to the Quenya preposition ve “as, like”). In the case of anda/andav¨
e,
the English translation is “long” in either case, but normally the ending -v¨
e
would correspond to English “-ly”. So if alta is “great”, can we use altav¨
e
for “greatly”? Since tulca is a word for “ﬁrm”, would “ﬁrmly” be tulcav¨
e?
Knowing that saila means “wise”, can we assume that sailav¨
e an accept-
able word for “wisely”? By and large, I think such formations are plausible,
though the potential application of the ending -v¨
e may not be literally lim-
itless. The Quenya adjective “good” is m´
ara; one wonders if m´
arav¨
e for
“well” would sound just as weird as “goodly” in English! (A basic adverb
vand¨
e “well” occurs in Tolkien’s earliest “Qenya” wordlist [QL:99]; whether
this was still a valid word in LotR-style Quenya some forty years later, none
can say.)
Like anda “long”, the vast majority of Quenya adjectives end in -a. The
less frequent adjectives in -¨
e in practically all cases descend from Primitive
Elvish forms in -i, which vowel would be preserved unchanged before an
ending or in compounds: Compare mor¨
e “dark, black” with the compound
Moriquendi “Dark Elves”. We must assume that the original quality of
the vowel would also be preferred before the adverbial ending -v¨
e – so if we
try to derive an adverb “darkly” from mor¨
e, it should probably be moriv¨
e
rather than morev¨
e. Actually, very few of the adjectives in -¨
e are likely
to have any corresponding adverbs; they mostly denote colours. Perhaps
we can have muss¨
e/mussiv¨
e “soft/softly”, nind¨
e/nindiv¨
e “thin/thinly”
and ring¨
e/ringiv¨
e “cold/coldly” (but in a later source, the word for “cold”
appears as ringa rather than ring¨
e, and then the adverb would simply be
ringav¨
e).
How the ending -v¨
e would be added to the few adjectives in -n is quite
unclear. The adjective melin “dear” (not to be confused with the similar-
sounding 1st person aorist “I love”) could have a corresponding adjective
melinv¨
e “dearly”, for while nv does not occur in unitary words, it is a
possible Quenya combination (cf. Aragorn’s title Envinyatar “Renewer”,
where en- = “re-”). On the other hand, if the ending -v¨
e is related to the
preposition ve “as, like”, both probably descend from be in Primitive Elvish.
We could then argue that the original melin-be would rather come out as
melimb¨
e in Quenya. On the yet other hand (if we can postulate even more
hands), adjectives in -in seem to be shortened from longer forms in -ina,
and then one could argue that this a would be preserved before an ending.
Thus, “dearly” could be melinav¨
e. (I’d say, forget about melin and start
153


from melda or moina instead, which adjectives also mean “dear”. Then we
can simply have meldav¨
e or moinav¨
e!)
In English at least, an adverb does not necessarily describe a verbal action.
It can also be used to modify the meaning of an adjective (or even another
adverb). This is a kind of meta-description, one descriptive word describing
another. Whether Quenya adverbs (or speciﬁcally the ones in -v¨
e) can be
used in such a way, nobody knows. For instance: Knowing that valaina is
the Quenya adjective “divine”, can we feel free to use valainav¨
e vanya
for “divinely beautiful”? Tolkien provided aqua as the adverb “fully, com-
pletely, altogether, wholly” (WJ:392 – this is a “basic” adverb not derived
from an adjective, unlike the English glosses in -ly that are derived from the
adjectives “full, complete, whole”). It does seem very likely that this aqua
can modify an adjective, e.g. aqua mor¨
e “completely dark”. If this is not
so, Tolkien ought to have told us. . . !
It may be noted that in some early sources, Tolkien uses adverbs in -o
rather than -v¨
e. The one attestation of the latter is, as I have pointed
out, andav¨
e vs. the adjective anda “long”. However, there exists an early
“Qenya” sentence which translates as “the Elves were lying long asleep at
Kovien´
eni [later: Cuivi´
enen]”; see Vinyar Tengwar #27. In this sentence, the
adverb “long” appears as ando, not andav¨
e. Further examples of adverbs
in -o include ento “next” and rato “soon” (from an “Arctic” sentence
quoted in Father Christmas Letters – obviously a form of “Qenya”, though
appearing in a context that has nothing to do with Tolkien’s serious literary
output). We may even include the adverb voro “ever, continually” from
such a relatively late source as the Etymologies (entry bor), though in this
word, the ﬁnal -o may be simply the stem-vowel reduplicated and suﬃxed.
The example ando “long” (not to be confused with the noun “gate”),
which is obviously derived from the adjective anda, would seem to indi-
cate that the ending -o can be used to derive adverbs from adjectives. May
we then have (say) tulco “ﬁrmly” from tulca “ﬁrm”, as an alternative to
tulcav¨
e? Or are we to understand that Tolkien, by the LotR period, had
dropped -o as an adverbial ending? If so he introduced -v¨
e as a replacement,
not an alternative (changing ando to andav¨
e).
We cannot know whether -o is still a valid adverbial ending in LotR-style
Quenya. But when deriving adverbs from adjectives, I would recommend
using the “safe” (or at least safer) ending -v¨
e instead. In the exercises below,
I have not used the ending -o, but only -v¨
e. On the other hand, at this stage
I would not tamper with attested adverbs like ento, rato, voro (changing
them to ?entav¨
e etc.)
Do adverbs, like adjectives, agree in number? It has been suggested that
andav¨
e is actually a plural adverb, agreeing with a plural verb (andav¨
e
laituvalmet “long we will praise them” – notice the plural subject ending
attached to the verb). If so, -v¨
e could be the plural form of a singular
adverbial ending -va, completely unattested. According to this system, we
154


would have such variation as i n´
er lend¨
e andava “the man traveled long”
(singular adverb corresponding to a singular verb) vs. i neri lender andav¨
e
“the men traveled long” (plural adverb to go with a plural verb). But this is
100 % hypothetical. While nothing can be ruled out at this stage, I tend to
believe that this there is no such variation. More likely, the adverbial ending
-v¨
e is invariable in form, related to the preposition ve “as, like” as suggested
above.
In closing, I should mention that some Quenya adverbs are derived from
other parts of speech than adjectives. In Nam´
ari¨
e we have oial¨
e as the ad-
verb “for ever” (or “everlastingly”, as the interlinear translation in RGEO:67
goes). But the Etymologies, entry oy, indicates that oial¨
e is properly or in
its origin a noun meaning “everlasting age”. Apparently this noun is used
as an adverb in Nam´
ari¨
e.
Phrases involving prepositions very often have an adverbial function to be-
gin with, and sometimes unitary adverbs may evolve from them: In Cirion’s
Oath we have tennoio as another Quenya word meaning “for ever”, but
in UT:317, Tolkien explains that this form is simply a contraction of two
originally distinct words: the preposition tenna “up to, as far as” + oio “an
endless period”.
Finally we have what I have already called “basic adverbs”, not derived
from any other part of speech. Aqua “completely” and s´
ı “now” men-
tioned above are just two examples; we may also include words like amba
“up(wards)”, h´
aya “far oﬀ” (read perhaps haiya as the Third Age form),
oi “ever”, and others.
10.2
The pronominal endings -nt¨
e and -t
In Lesson Eight, we introduced three pronominal endings: -n or longer -ny¨
e
for “I”, -l or longer -ly¨
e for “you”, and -s for “it”. But obviously there are
more pronouns, and we will now attempt to identify the pronominal endings
of the Third Person Plural: as subject “they”, as object “them”.
Cirion’s Oath in UT:305 includes the word tiruvantes, in UT:317 trans-
lated “they will guard it”. The verb tir- “watch, guard”, the future-tense
ending -uva “shall, will” and the pronominal ending -s “it” ought to be
familiar to the student by now. We are left with -nte- as the element trans-
lated “they”. UT:317 explicitly conﬁrms that -nt¨
e is the “inﬂection of 3[rd
person] plural where no subject is previously mentioned”. Like most brief
linguistic notes of Tolkien’s, this one does require some exegesis. I shall here
assume that Tolkien’s intention is this: If a sentence has a plural subject that
has been “previously mentioned”, occurring before the verb, the verb would
only receive the normal plural ending -r (e.g. i neri matir apsa “the men
eat meat”). But if there is no subject “previously mentioned”, the ending
-r is replaced by -nt¨
e, meaning “they”: Matint¨
e apsa, “they eat meat”.
155


Apparently, this ending would still be used if the subject is identiﬁed later in
the sentence; perhaps we can have such a sentence as matint¨
e apsa i neri
“they eat meat(,) the men (do)”. Cirion’s Oath also identiﬁes the subject
later in the sentence (nai tiruvantes i h´
arar mahalmassen mi N´
umen
“be it that they will guard it, the ones who sit on thrones in the west. . . ”)
Cirion’s Oath occurs in post-LotR material, so the information provided in
UT:305, 317 was certainly intended to be LotR-compatible. However, a quite
diﬀerent pronominal ending for “they” occurs in Tolkien’s early material. In
LT1:114, we ﬁnd the “Qenya” form tulielto “they have come”, including
the ending -lto for “they”. This ending was current as late as when Tolkien
wrote F´
ıriel’s Song, which includes the forms c´
arielto “they made” and
antalto “they gave” (LR:72). Whether it is also valid in LotR-style Quenya
is another matter. The ending -lto looks somewhat strange compared to
the other known pronominal endings. Of the pronominal endings attested in
LotR or during the post-LotR period, all the subject endings that constitute
a separate syllable end in the vowel -¨
e (six endings in all, if we include -nt¨
e
discussed above). A suﬃx -lto ending in -o doesn’t seem to ﬁt in very well
(so some would alter -lto to -lt¨
e in LotR-style Quenya, though there is
no evidence for such an ending). I tend to assume that Tolkien eventually
scrapped this ending completely, replacing it with -nt¨
e.
The opinion has been voiced that -lto is valid all the same. Some would in-
terpret Tolkien’s note about -nt¨
e being used “where no subject is previously
mentioned” in an absolute sense: It wouldn’t be enough that the subject has
not been “previously mentioned” in the same sentence, as I assumed above.
Of course, when the word “they” is used in English, it usually refers back to
some group mentioned earlier in the text or conversation. According to the
strict interpretation of Tolkien’s note about -nt¨
e, this pronominal ending
cannot be used for any “they” that refers back to some group mentioned
earlier, even if it was in a quite diﬀerent sentence. The ending -nt¨
e would
only point forward, to some group that is to be identiﬁed later in the text
or sentence (as is the case in Cirion’s Oath). “They” referring back to some
other group (already mentioned in another sentence) would require a quite
diﬀerent ending, perhaps the -lto attested in earlier sources.
I can’t claim that this isn’t a possible interpretation of Tolkien’s words
or the available examples. However, I still have a bad feeling about using
the ending -lto in LotR-style Quenya. In the exercises I have made for this
course, I have ignored -lto, assuming that -nt¨
e can be used as a pronominal
ending signifying “they” in a general sense. When Tolkien speaks of -nt¨
e
being used only for a subject that has not been “previously mentioned”,
I assume that he means “not previously mentioned in the same sentence”
(for if a plural subject had already occurred, the verb would receive only
the normal plural marker -r). Hence we can – presumably – have forms like
these, with -nt¨
e attached to the various tenses of pusta- “to stop”:
156


Aorist pustant¨
e “they stop”
Present pust¨
eant¨
e “they are stopping”
Past pustanent¨
e “they stopped”
Future pustuvant¨
e “they will stop”
Perfect upustient¨
e “they have stopped”
As indicated by the attested example tiruvantes = “they will guard it”, a
second pronominal ending can be attached following -nt¨
e (-nte-), denoting
the object of the sentence. This brings us over to another question: If -nt¨
e is
the subject ending “they”, what is the corresponding object ending “them”?
Discussing adverbs above, we have already quoted the sentence andav¨
e
laituvalmet “long we will praise them” from LotR. Knowing that laitu-
valmet means “we will praise them”, we can easily isolate the ﬁnal -t as
the element translated “them”. (The cunning student will also be able to
isolate the pronominal ending signifying “we”, but we will save that one for
later: Actually Quenya has several endings for “we”, with diﬀerent shades
of meaning.)
As usual, things are not quite crystal clear. The ones being praised here
are Frodo and Sam, two persons. Some have therefore assumed that this -t is
a dual “them”, even suggesting that laituvalmet may be rendered “we will
praise both [of them]”. Those adhering to this theory have been encouraged
by the fact that there is also a dual ending -t (as in ciryat “2 ships”; look
up Lesson Three again). Nothing can be deﬁnitely ruled out at this time,
but the ending -t “them” would seem to match -nt¨
e “they” quite well. I
don’t think -t is exclusively dual, but in any case, this is one ending that
can be translated “them”. Hence, forms like the following must be possible:
Tirnenyet = “I watched them”
Melilyet = “you love them”
Hiruvanyet = “I will ﬁnd them”
and even:
Pustanentet = “they stopped them”
Likely, this would refer to two diﬀerent groups. “They stopped themselves”
is probably expressed in another way (unfortunately we don’t really know
how).
10.3
Inﬁnitives with object pronouns
So far, we have identiﬁed two pronominal endings that can be used as the
object of the sentence, -s for “it” and -t for “they”. As is evident from
attested examples (tiruvantes “they will guard it”, laituvalmet “we will
praise them”), these object endings may be attached to a ﬁnite verb following
157


another pronominal ending denoting the subject. But what about a longer
verbal phrase involving an inﬁnitive?
Let us start with a sentence like i m´
ol veryan¨
e cen¨
e i aran ar i t´
ari,
“the thrall dared to see the king and the queen”. Here we have a ﬁnite
verb veryan¨
e “dared” + an inﬁnitive cen¨
e “to see”. Now we want to get
rid of the whole phrase “the king and the queen”, replacing it with the
object pronoun “them”, hence “the thrall dared to see them”. (Notice that I
deliberately construct an example that will be compatible with the theory of
-t “them” being dual only, even though I don’t believe this to be the case. . .
unnecessary risks are just that, unnecessary!) Well, where do we put the
ending -t? Quite obviously, it must be attached to the inﬁnitive cen¨
e “to
see”. Cenet, then? Or, since the inﬁnitive cen¨
e seems to represent Primitive
Elvish keni and primitive -i changes to -¨
e only when ﬁnal, one might think
that cenit is a better choice. So “the thrall dared to see them” = i m´
ol
veryan¨
e cenit, right?
Wrong! In Vinyar Tengwar #41, July 2000, it was revealed that the in-
ﬁnitive of primary verbs is formed with the ending -ita if any pronominal
endings are to be added (actually the suﬃx is only -ta-, which added to an
inﬁnitive like cen¨
e = ceni- produces cenita-). Tolkien in some of his late
(ca. 1969) notes refers to “the general (aorist) ‘inﬁnitive’ formed by adding
-i (not as such capable of any further suﬃxion; with pronominal aﬃxes it
was the stem of the aorist tense); the particular inﬁnitive with -ita diﬀering
in use from the preceding mainly in being able to receive pronominal object
aﬃxes” (VT41:17). He went on to quote the example caritas, “doing it” (or
probably just as well “to do it”) – an inﬁnitive of the verb car- “do” with
the object ending -s “it” attached.
As I pointed out in the previous lesson, it is unclear whether the reference
to an inﬁnitive constructed by “adding -i” implies that there is a contempo-
rary Quenya inﬁnitive that shows the ending -i. Tolkien may simply refer to
the original form of the inﬁnitive ending, e.g. Primitive Elvish kweti as the
form underlying the contemporary Quenya form quet¨
e “(to) speak” (at-
tested in the sentence polin quet¨
e “I can speak”). Anyhow, this inﬁnitive
was “not as such capable of any further suﬃxation”, apparently to avoid
confusion with “the stem of the aorist tense”. The inﬁnitive of car- “make,
do” would be car¨
e (cari-), but if we tried to add an ending like -s “it” di-
rectly to it in order to express “to do it”, the resulting form **caris would
look just like the aorist “it does” or “it makes”. The actual form caritas is
not ambiguous.
In the case of “they make” vs. “to make them”, there would be a dis-
tinction even without the extra -ta-, since the subject ending for “they”
(-nt¨
e) diﬀers from the object ending “them” (-t). Even so, Tolkien appar-
ently decided to eliminate any possible confusion between aorist forms with
subject endings and inﬁnitives with object endings: The inﬁnitives insert
-ta- between the inﬁnitive proper and the pronominal suﬃxes. Therefore,
158


the inﬁnitive “to see” is expanded from cen¨
e to cenita- when it is to receive
any object ending. “The thrall dared to see them” must actually be i m´
ol
veryan¨
e cenitat, the extra -ta- intruding between the inﬁnitive and the
object ending.
It is unclear whether A-stem verbs behave in the same way. Vinyar Teng-
war #41 published only a very brief quote from Tolkien’s 1969 notes (the
editor apparently needed the space for more important things, like an in-
depth article about the optimal Bulgarian translation of the Ring Poem).
The quote, reproduced above, apparently only deals with the inﬁnitive form
of primary verbs – the ones that have aorists in -¨
e or with endings -i-. Some
writers have assumed that A-stem verbs functioning as inﬁnitives would
similarly add -ta before any object pronominal endings are suﬃxed. So with
verbs like metya- “to end, to put an end to” and mapa- “to seize”, it would
work something like this:
Merint¨
e metyatas “they want to end it”
I ohtari ´
uvar mapatat “the warriors will not seize them”
Perhaps such sentences are quite OK, perhaps not. Presently there is no
way of telling. One may doubt that the ending -ta would be added to the
stem of a verb that ends in -ta already, like orta- “to lift up, to raise”.
Should “I can lift it” really be polin ortatas? Generally, Quenya is not
very fond of two adjacent similar-sounding syllables, like the two ta’s here.
Luckily, we can work around this uncertainty. We can simply avoid at-
taching object pronominal endings to the inﬁnitives of A-stem verbs, since
we know at least some independent object pronouns (e.g. te “them” in-
stead of the ending -t – so for, say, “you wanted to seize them” we can have
mernely¨
e mapa te instead of the uncertain construction ?mernely¨
e ma-
patat). We will discuss the independent pronouns in a later lesson. In the
exercises below, the inﬁnitives in -ita + object suﬃx only involve primary
verbs.
It is interesting to notice that Tolkien translated caritas as “doing it”
(VT41:17). This may suggest that such inﬁnitives can also function as the
subject of a sentence, e.g. cenitas farya nin “seeing it is enough for me”
(farya- verb “to suﬃce, to be enough”; nin “to/for me”).
10.4
The past tense of intransitive verbs in -ya
In Lesson Six, we set out some rules for “regular” past tense formation, but
we also touched on various “irregular” forms (that is, past tense formations
that don’t readily fall into the most common patterns). Some of these may
actually form sub-groups that are “regular” enough according to their own
special rules.
Let me ﬁrst introduce a couple of terms that will facilitate the following
discussion: transitive and intransitive. In linguist terminology, a verb is said
159


to be transitive if it can have an object. Most verbs readily can, but not all.
A verb like “to fall” is not transitive (= intransitive). The subject itself may
“fall”, but the subject cannot “fall” something else; there can be no object.
A typical intransitive verb only describes an action which the subject itself
performs, not an action that is, or can be, done to someone or something. (I
say “typical”, for Quenya actually has some verbs that cannot even have a
subject, the so-called impersonal verbs – to be discussed in Lesson Eighteen.)
Some verbs form pairs where one verb is transitive, the other intransitive.
The subject may raise an object (transitively), but the subject by itself can
only rise (intransitively) – not involving any object at all. Other examples of
such pairs include transitive “to fell” vs. intransitive “to fall”, or transitive
“to lay” vs. intransitive “to lie”. But in many cases, English uses the same
verb form both intransitively and transitively, e.g. “to sink”. A subject may
sink an object (e.g. “the torpedo sank the ship”, transitive verb with both
subject and object), or the subject just “sinks” all by itself, so to speak
(e.g. “the ship sank”, intransitive verb with subject only – obviously “sank”
is used with two quite diﬀerent meanings here). Such ambiguity may also
occur in Quenya; for instance, orta- covers both “to raise” and “to rise”,
and the context must be taken into account to determine which meaning is
relevant. (To be more concrete: check if the sentence includes an object or
not! E.g. i aran orta = “the king rises”, but i aran orta ranco = “the
king raises an arm”.)
Let us then consider some “irregular” Quenya verbs. The verb farya- “to
suﬃce, to be enough” is said to have the past tense farn¨
e, irregular in the
sense that the ending -ya of the verbal stem drops out before the past tense
ending -n¨
e: We might have expected **faryan¨
e, but the Etymologies lists
a few more verbs that exemplify the same phenomenon: Vanya- “to go,
depart, disappear” has the past tense vann¨
e. (Likely, Tolkien later replaced
the verb vanya- with auta- of similar meaning, but we may still consider it
here.) To these examples from the Etymologies (see entries phar, wan) we
may add a verb the student is supposed to have memorized as part of the
previous lesson: lelya- “to go, proceed, travel” from WJ:363. Its past tense
is not **lelyan¨
e, but lend¨
e, seemingly a quite irregular form (though not
as wildly irregular as English “to go” vs. its past tense “went”!) The sudden
appearance of the cluster nd is no big mystery; it arises by nasal-inﬁxion
of the original root led. (This root is listed in the Etymologies, though
according to a later source, led is reworked from even more primitive del.
Lelya- is meant to descend from primitive ledyˆ
a- [ledjˆ
a-], “since dj became
ly medially in Quenya” [WJ:363]. The past tense lend¨
e would come from
lendˆ
e, not so dissimilar from the verb ledyˆ
a- as these forms later became.)
The real mystery here is this: Why do the verbs farya-, vanya-, and lelya-
surrender the ending -ya in the past tense?
It may be noted that by their meaning, all three verbs are distinctly
intransitive: To suﬃce, to disappear, to go. This could be just a coincidence,
160


of course, but the Etymologies provides us with another highly interesting
example. In the entry ulu, a verb ulya- “to pour” is listed. Tolkien indicated
that it has a double past tense. If the verb is used in a transitive sense,
as in “the servant poured water into a cup”, the past tense “poured” is
ulyan¨
e. This would be an entirely “regular” form. However, if the verb
is used intransitively, the past tense of ulya- is ull¨
e instead (presumably
representing older unl¨
e, formed by nasal-inﬁxion from ul- without the ending
-ya; cf. vill¨
e as the past tense of vil- “to ﬂy”, though in the latter case no
ending -ya appears in any form of the verb). So if you want to translate
“the river poured into a gorge”, the form to use is ull¨
e, not ulyan¨
e.
It seems, then, that we can discern a pattern here: Intransitive verbs in
-ya drop this ending in the past tense; the past tense is formed from the
ending-less root, as in the case of primary verbs. Or put diﬀerently: In the
past tense, intransitive verbs in -ya surrender this ending to masquerade as
primary verbs. In the rare cases where a verb can be both transitive and
intransitive, the ending -ya is retained when it is used in a transitive sense
(as in the pa.t. form ulyan¨
e), but dropped when the verb is used in an
intransitive sense (ull¨
e).
Why this should be so is of course entirely obscure. In other tenses than
the past, the verb ulya- “to pour” would seem to appear in the same form no
matter whether it is transitive or intransitive (aorist ulya “pours”, present
tense uly¨
ea “is pouring”, future ulyuva “shall pour” etc.) But it was never
Tolkien’s intention to make a new Esperanto, a language aiming to be 100
% regular and logical. Within his mythos, Quenya is supposed to be an
ordinary spoken tongue, developed over thousands of years. Hence, Tolkien
may deliberately have included what you will ﬁnd in any natural language:
certain features that don’t necessarily make immediate “sense”.
Most verbs in -ya are transitive, and would presumably retain their ending
in the past tense, before the pa.t. suﬃx -n¨
e is added (as in the attested
example ulyan¨
e). Here are most of the remaining intransitive verbs in -ya,
though Tolkien did not actually mention any past tense forms in their case:
hwinya- “to swirl, to gyrate” (past tense hwinn¨
e?), mirilya- “to glitter”
(pa.t. mirill¨
e? – cf. ulya-, pa.t. ull¨
e), ranya- “to stray” (pa.t. rann¨
e?),
s´
uya- “to breathe” (pa.t. s´
un¨
e?), tiuya- “to swell, grow fat” (pa.t. tiun¨
e?)
The verb yerya- can be both transitive “to wear (out)” and intransitive
“to get old”. Perhaps the past tense is yeryan¨
e in the former sense and
yern¨
e in the latter sense, just like we have transitive ulyan¨
e coexisting
with intransitive ull¨
e as the past tense “poured”?
I should add that all of this is somewhat hypothetical, since Tolkien did
not actually mention the past tense of very many intransitive verbs in -ya.
But the student should at least notice the attested “irregular” past tenses,
including the double pa.t. of ulya- “to pour” and especially lend¨
e “went”
as the rather unexpected past tense form of lelya- “to go, travel, proceed”.
NOTE: The perfect tense of this verb appears as lendi¨
e in some texts. SD:56 indicates
161


that in one draft, Tolkien used lendien rather than ut´
ulien for “I have come” in Elendil’s
Declaration (“out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth have I come”). Lendien would mean,
literally, “I have gone/went/traveled” or something similar. This perfect form is not aug-
mented, possibly simply because Tolkien had not yet invented the augment that is usually
preﬁxed in the perfect tense. I would normally supply it, using elendi¨
e as the perfect of
lelya-. I have used this perfect in (the key to) one of the exercises below.
10.5
Passive participles
Then we will return to the participles. The logical counterpart of the active
participles discussed in the previous lesson is obviously the passive partici-
ples. They are often called “past participles” instead (just like the active
participles are frequently referred to as “present participles”). However, the
term “passive participle” is very ﬁtting. This participle is an adjectival form
derived from the stem of a verb, and it describes the state that something
or someone is left in by being exposed to the corresponding verbal action.
For instance: If you hide something, it is hidden. Therefore, “hidden” is the
passive participle of the verb “to hide”. The word “hidden” can be used as
an adjective, both predicatively (“the treasure is hidden”) and attributively
(“hidden treasure”). The passive participle “hidden” contrasts with the ac-
tive participle “hiding”: The latter describes the state of the subject, the
acting party, whereas the passive participle describes the state of the object,
the one passively exposed to the verbal action.
In the case of intransitive verbs, where no object can be involved, this
participle describes the state of the subject itself after carrying out the
verbal action in question: If you fall, you will thereafter be fallen; if you
go, you will thereafter be gone. Here the often-used term “past participle”
makes sense; participles like fallen or gone describe the condition of the
subject after carrying out some “past” action. They are seen to contrast
with the “present participles” (active participles) falling and going, which
describe the condition of the subject while the verbal action is still “present”
or on-going. But as long as we are dealing with transitive verbs – and most
verbs are transitive – I still think it is better to speak of “active participles”
vs. “passive participles”.
In English, quite a few passive participles have the ending -en, as in the
examples hidden, fallen above. But in very many cases, English passive
participles are similar in form to the past tense of verbs, though the words
have wildly diﬀerent functions (a form like tormented is a past tense verb
in a sentence like “they tormented the Dwarf”, but a passive participle in
a sentence like “the Dwarf was tormented”). So what do the corresponding
Quenya forms look like?
The vast majority of Quenya participles seem to be formed by means of
the ending -na or its longer variant -ina. Some attested A-stem participles
162


are seen to include the longer ending, the ﬁnal -a of the verbal stem and the
i of the suﬃx -ina merging into a diphthong -ai- (which receives the stress,
like any diphthong in the second-to-last syllable). An example is provided by
the phrase Arda Hastaina, “Arda Marred”, an Elvish term for the world
as it is, tainted by the evil of Morgoth (MR:254). This hastaina “marred”
would seem to be the passive participle of a verb hasta- “to mar”, not
otherwise attested. However, the verb hosta- “to gather, collect, assemble”
is attested both in the Etymologies (entry khoth) and in the Markirya
poem (MC:222–223). Its passive participle turns up in F´
ıriel’s Song, where
it is implied to be hostaina (attested in the form hostaini´
eva “will be
gathered”; the suﬃx -i´
eva “will be” is hardly valid in LotR-style Quenya,
but the underlying participle certainly is). We can probably conclude that
A-stems in -ta nearly always have passive participles in -taina. Since anta-
means “give”, the participle “given” would be antaina. Since orta- means
“raise” (or used intransitively, “rise”), the word for “raised” (and “risen”)
would seem to be ortaina.
Perhaps the ending -ina can be added to nearly all A-stems? From a
verb like mapa- “grasp, seize”, I think we may well derive mapaina as
the participle “grasped, seized”. (Indirect support for this: The ending -
ina is also used to derive adjectives, as in valaina “divine” – obviously
an adjectival formation based on Vala, which noun is analogous in form
to a simple A-stem like mapa-. Indeed it is hinted that the noun Vala
is originally derived from a simple A-stem verb vala- “to order, to have
power”: WJ:403–4. If it had remained a verb only, valaina could have meant
“ordered” instead.)
The behaviour of A-stems in -ya is slightly obscure. In the Etymologies,
Tolkien listed a root per “divide in middle, halve” (cf. Sindarin Perian
“halﬂing, Hobbit”). He then mentioned a Quenya word perya, evidently a
verb preserving the root meaning. Immediately after perya, he listed an
undeﬁned word perina. Is this the passive participle “halved”? I think this
is almost certainly the meaning of this word, but perhaps we should see it as
an independent adjectival formation derived directly from the root, not as
the passive participle of the verb perya-. (We might have excepted p´
erina
with a long ´
e if it were a passive participle; see below regarding the r´
acina
pattern.)
Elsewhere in the Etymologies, in the entry gyer, we have a verb yerya-
“to wear (out), get old”. The same entry also mentions a word yerna “worn”.
As far as the English glosses are concerned, yerna could be the passive par-
ticiple of the verb yerya-. Should we conclude, then, that verbs in -ya form
their passive participles by replacing this ending with -na? Again I think
yerna is not actually the participle of yerya-, but rather an independent ad-
jectival formation. The following facts support this: 1) Tolkien traced yerna
all the way back to Primitive Elvish gyernˆ
a, so it was not derived from the
verb later; 2) Tolkien actually listed the form yerna before he mentioned
163


the verb yerya-, again suggesting that the former is not to be derived from
the latter, 3) yerna is glossed “old” as well as “worn”, and the ﬁrst gloss
suggests that yerna is to be considered an independent adjective, not a par-
ticiple. Same story as with perina above, then. This would also go for a pair
like halya- “veil” vs. halda “veiled, hidden” (entry skal1): The latter form
Tolkien referred to Primitive Elvish skalnˆ
a (initial sk- becoming h- and ln
becoming ld in Quenya). It may well be that in Primitive Elvish, skalnˆ
a did
count as the passive participle of the verbal root skal- “screen, hide”, but
its Quenya descendant halda has developed into an independent adjective
(one of Tolkien’s glosses for this word, “shady”, is also an adjective). Thus,
halda is not necessarily the passive participle of the verb halya- derived
from the same root, though it has somewhat the same meaning as the actual
participle would have.
So how, really, are we to treat verbs in -ya? I think a highly interesting
clue is provided in MR:326 (cf. MR:315), where Christopher Tolkien tells us
that in a post-LotR text, Tolkien used Mirruyainar or Mirroyainar for
“the Incarnate” (plural). This may seem to be passive participles inﬂected
as nouns: “incarnated ones”. Removing the plural ending -r, we are left with
mirruyaina/mirroyaina as a possible participle “incarnated” – and if we
peel away the presumed participial ending as well, the verb “to incarnate”
would seem to be mirruya- or mirroya-. Tolkien later changed the word
Mirruyainar/Mirroyainar to Mirroanwi, not involving any -ya- at all,
but the rejected forms may still give away what the passive participle of
a verb in -ya should look like. Such verbs would seem to have participles
in -yaina, just like verbs in -ta have participles in -taina. So given that
lanya- is the verb “to weave”, the word for “woven” may well be lanyaina.
The regular passive participles of the verbs perya- “to halve”, yerya- “to
wear (out)” and halya- “to veil” would similarly be peryaina, yeryaina,
halyaina (meaning much the same as the related adjectives perina, yerna,
halda, of course, but the latter may not so clearly imply that the described
states are inﬂicted – see below regarding harna- vs. harnaina).
We can probably conclude that nearly all A-stem verbs form their pas-
sive participles by adding -ina. The only exception occurring in the pub-
lished corpus is the form envinyanta “healed” or more literally “renewed”
(MR:405). It would seem to be the passive participle of a verb enviny-
ata- “renew” (not attested by itself, but cf. Aragorn’s title Envinyatar
“Renewer”). This participle is formed by means of nasal-inﬁxion intruding
before the ending -ta. We cannot know whether the more “regular” forma-
tion envinyataina, itself unattested, would be a valid form.
However, the ending -ina is not only used in the case of A-stems; pri-
mary verbs with c or t as their ﬁnal consonant also form their passive
participles by means of this ending. The Markirya poem includes a form
r´
acina “broken” (man tiruva r´
acina cirya[?] “who shall see [/watch] a
broken ship?”, MR:222). Tolkien explicitly identiﬁed r´
acina as the passive
164


(or “past”) participle of the verb rac- “to break” (MC:223). The verb “to
reckon, to count” is not-, and in F´
ıriel’s Song we have n´
otina as the passive
participle “counted”. It seems, then, that primary verbs ending in unvoiced
stops like c or t form their passive participles by lengthening the stem-vowel
and adding the long ending -ina. We don’t seem to have any attested exam-
ple of the participle of a primary verb ending in -p (another unvoiced stop),
but it would in all likelihood slip into the same pattern: The verb top- “to
cover” would have the passive participle t´
opina “covered”. (The verb top-
is listed in the Etymologies; the poem Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR may suggest that
Tolkien later changed it to tup-. If so, the participle would of course be
t´
upina instead.) Perhaps primary verbs in -v also form their passive par-
ticiples according to this pattern, e.g. l´
avina “allowed, granted” from the
verb lav- “allow, grant” (not to be confused with a similar-sounding verb
meaning “lick”). We lack examples, though.
Attested examples don’t exactly abound for other primary verbs either,
but most of them probably prefer the short ending -na to -ina. MR:408 (cf.
MR:405) indicates that Tolkien used vincarna for “healed”; the more literal
meaning is transparently “renewed” or wholly literally “newly-made”: Vin-
is the stem of the Quenya adjective vinya “new”, and carna “made” can
only be the passive participle of the verb car- “make”. So primary verbs
ending in -r have passive participles in -rna (and because of the consonant
cluster here arising, the stem-vowel preceding it obviously can not be length-
ened as in the r´
acina class discussed above). Given that mer- is the Quenya
verb “to want”, the Wanted posters of the Quenya Wild West would evi-
dently read Merna. Perhaps m´
erina, c´
arina (following r´
acina) would be
possible alternative passive participles of mer-, car-, perhaps not. I think
it is best to let the attested example carna guide us here.
For primary verbs in -m and -n, we only have what may be called in-
direct examples of their passive participles, but they are probably good
enough. The verb nam- “to judge” (namin “I judge”, VT41:13) seems
to have the passive participle namna. This form is attested as a noun
meaning “statute” (as in Namna Finw¨
e M´
ıriello, “the Statute of Finw¨
e
and M´
ıriel”, MR:258). Apparently the participle namna, basically meaning
“judged”, is also used as a noun “judgement, juridical decision” and then
“statute”. As for primary verbs in -n, we may consider such nouns as anna
“gift” and onna “creature” vs. the verbs anta- “to give” and onta- “to
create” (see the entries ana1, ono in Etym). These are not primary verbs,
of course (and in Quenya we would expect them to have the participles an-
taina, ontaina) – but the nouns anna, onna may descend from primitive
participial formations based on the naked root-word, before -ta was added
to produce the verbs as they appear in Quenya. So anna may come from
a primitive participle “given”, only later used as a noun “something that is
given” = “gift”. Onna might likewise represent an original passive partici-
ple “created”, later used as a noun “created one” = “creature”. I tend to
165


think, therefore, that the ending -na can be added to the stems of Quenya
primary verbs ending in -n. For instance, since cen- is the verb “to see”,
cenna may well be the passive participle “seen”. But again, c´
enina may be
a permissible alternative formation (perhaps we can also have n´
amina for
“judged”, for all I know).
What about primary verbs in -l, such as mel- “love”? If we don’t resort
to the pattern of r´
acina once again, using m´
elina for “loved”, the ending
-na would have to be added directly to the verbal stem. But since **melna
is not a possible Quenya word, ln would become ld, just as in one example
discussed above (Quenya halda descending from Primitive Elvish skalnˆ
a).
The Etymologies actually lists a word melda, glossed “beloved, dear”. These
glosses are adjectives, but by their meaning they are of course very close to
the participle “loved”. So are we once again looking at an original participle
that has developed into an independent adjective? Would the actual partici-
ple of mel- diﬀer in form, precisely to distinguish it from this adjective? If
so we might consider m´
elina again. Or is melda both the adjective “dear”
and the participle “loved”? One may well ask whether there is any point
in even trying to distinguish between them, since their meanings would be
virtually the same.
Another example may also be considered: The Quenya verb “to bear, to
wear, to carry” seems to be col-, though it has never been independently
attested: Only various derivations are found in our corpus. One of them
appears in MR:385: colla = “borne, worn” (also used as a noun “vest-
ment, cloak”, considered as “something that is worn”). Is this an example
of the past participle of a primary verb ending in -l? Can we use mella for
“loved”, then? I tend to think that colla is rather an adjectival derivative –
perhaps representing primitive konlˆ
a with nasal-inﬁxion of the root kol (not
in Etym). By its original derivation it would then parallel such a Quenya ad-
jective as panta “open” (which Tolkien referred to Primitive Elvish pantˆ
a,
derived from the root pat listed in Etym). I’m afraid no quite certain con-
clusion can be reached regarding the passive participles of primary verbs in
-l, but I think the safest would be to either use the ending -da (representing
earlier -na), or the longer ending -ina combined with lengthening of the
stem-vowel.
Should passive participles agree in number, like normal adjectives do? In
other words, should the ﬁnal -a turn into -¨
e (for older -ai) if the participle
describes a plural noun? As far as I can see, the corpus provides no example
that could guide us. We recall that active participles (ending -la) do not
agree in number. However, I tend to think that passive participles do be-
have like normal adjectives in this regard. We have just seen that in many
cases it is diﬃcult to even determine whether a form is to be considered a
passive participle or an adjective, since adjectives may be derived with the
same endings. (For that matter, this goes for English as well: An adjective
like naked could well have been a passive participle by its form; however,
166


there is no corresponding verb **nake “denude”, so we can’t set up a pair
**nake/naked like we have love/loved.) Since adjectives like valaina “di-
vine” and yerna “old” must be assumed to agree in number, it is diﬃcult
to imagine that participles like hastaina “marred” or carna “made” would
not show such agreement. So I would change the ﬁnal -a to -¨
e where the
participle describes a plural noun (or several nouns).
In English, past/passive participles are used as part of the circumlocutions
which simulate the function of a true perfect tense: “The Dwarf has seen
the Elf”; “the woman is (or, has) fallen”. But here Quenya would simply
use the real perfect tense instead: I Nauco ec´
eni¨
e i Elda; i n´
ıs alanti¨
e.
Perhaps n´
a lantaina is also permissible for “is fallen”, but rendering “the
Dwarf has seen the Elf” as **i Nauco harya cenna i Elda (copying the
English wording directly) only results in nonsense.
A ﬁnal note: In some cases, forms in -na that were originally participial or
adjectival have themselves become A-stem verbs. The primitive word skarnˆ
a,
listed in the entry skar in the Etymologies, was perhaps originally a passive
participle “torn, rent” (since the root skar itself is said to mean “tear,
rend”). In Quenya, skarnˆ
a turned into harna “wounded”, probably felt to
be an adjective rather than a participle. The funny thing is that harna- also
came to be used as a verb “to wound”, and if this verb has its own passive
participle harnaina, we would have come full circle! In English, both harna
and harnaina must be translated “wounded”, but whereas harna would
merely describe the state of being wounded, harnaina clearly implies that
the wounds were inﬂicted. Cf. the English adjective “full” (merely describing
a state) vs. the passive participle “ﬁlled” (implying that the state in question
results from the act of ﬁlling).
Summary of Lesson Ten
Adverbs are words used to ﬁll in extra information about the how, the when,
or the where of the verbal action described in a sentence. In English at least,
an adverb can also be used to modify the meaning of an adjective, or even
another adverb. – The Quenya pronominal ending for “they” is apparently
-nt¨
e (Tolkien probably dropped the ending -lto occurring in early material);
the corresponding object ending “them” seems to be -t (though some think
it is dual “the two of them” only). – Primary verbs, which have inﬁnitives in
-¨
e (e.g. quet¨
e “to speak, to say”), turn into forms in -ita- if a pronominal
ending denoting the object is to be added (e.g. quetitas “to say it”, with
the ending -s “it”). – Available examples seem to suggest that intransitive
verbs in -ya drop this ending in the past tense, which is formed directly
from the stem instead (as if the verb were a primary verb). For instance, the
pa.t. of farya- “to suﬃce” is farn¨
e, not **faryan¨
e. – Passive participles
are adjectival derivatives that usually describe the state that is inﬂicted on
167


someone or something by the corresponding verbal action: what you hide
(verb) becomes hidden (passive participle). A-stem verbs seem to form their
passive participles in -ina (e.g. hastaina “marred” from hasta- “to mar”).
This ending is also used in the case of primary verbs ending in -t and -c,
probably also -p and possibly even -v; in this class of verbs, the ending is
combined with lengthening of the stem-vowel (e.g. r´
acina “broken” from
rac- “to break”). It may be that the same pattern can be applied to all
primary verbs, but verbs in -r are seen to take the simple ending -na instead,
with no lengthening of the stem-vowel (carna “made” from car- “to make”).
Primary verbs in -m, and probably also -n, would similarly take the simple
ending -na (e.g. namna “judged” from nam- “to judge”, cenna “seen”
from cen- “to see”). It is somewhat uncertain how we should treat primary
verbs in -l; if we are to use the simple ending -na, it would turn into -da for
phonological reasons (e.g. melna > melda “loved” as the passive participle
of mel- “to love”; melda is attested as an adjective “beloved, dear”). Passive
participles probably agree in number in the same way as adjectives, changing
-a to -¨
e if they describe a plural noun or several nouns.

Lesson 11
The concept of cases. The Genitive case.
11.1
Cases
Lessons 1–10 have mainly been concerned with adjectives and verbs. As for
nouns, we have only discussed how their plural and dual forms are con-
structed. There is, however, much more to say about the inﬂection the
Quenya noun. The second half of this course will predominantly be con-
cerned with the elaborate case system of Quenya, which is indeed the most
characteristic feature of the language. It is in the treatment of nouns that
the grammatical structure of Quenya most clearly reﬂects two of Tolkien’s
inspirations, Finnish and Latin.
What, linguistically speaking, are cases? A noun may have many functions
in a sentence. English may indicate what function a noun has by means of
word order alone. In a sentence like “the man loves the woman”, it is merely
the word order that gives away the fact that “the man” is the subject and
“the woman” is the object. The rule that very early slips into the subcon-
scious mind of children exposed to English goes something like this: “The
noun in front of the predicate verb is its subject, while the noun that comes
after it is normally its object.” Where word order is not enough, English
may slip in clarifying prepositions in front of a noun, e.g. “to” in a sentence
like “the Elf gives a gift to the Dwarf”. There are languages that wouldn’t
need to have a “to” here; instead the noun “Dwarf” would occur in a special,
inﬂectional form.
Of course, Quenya also has prepositions, and the student will already have
encountered several: nu “under”, or “over”, imb¨
e “between”, ve “as, like”,
mir “into” (which word, by the way, is formed from the simpler preposition
mi “in”). But it is a characteristic of Quenya that where English would
often place a preposition in front of a noun, or rely on word order alone to
indicate what the function of a noun is, Quenya would have a special form
of the noun which by itself indicates its function. These various, specialized
noun-forms are called cases. For instance, our example above – “the Elf gives
a gift to the Dwarf” – would translate into Quenya something like i Elda
170


anta anna i Naucon, where the case ending -n added to Nauco “Dwarf”
corresponds to the English preposition “to”. (This particular case is called
the dative, to be fully discussed in Lesson 13.)
Certain prepositions may also demand that the word (noun or pronoun)
following them appears inﬂected for some case – sometimes quite irrespective
of the normal, independent function of this case. The relevant preposition is
then said to “take” (or “govern”) this or that case. The same phenomenon
may be found in English, if one looks closely. While the case system is all
but gone as far as English nouns are concerned, many English pronouns at
least preserve a speciﬁc form that is used when the pronoun is the object
and not the subject of a sentence. That is why “Peter saw he” is wrong; it
must be “Peter saw him”, with the object form of this pronoun. (“He” is the
subject form instead, and therefore quite proper in a sentence like “he saw
Peter”.) But while the primary function of the form “him” is to function as
the object of a sentence, very many prepositions also insist on being followed
by this form. For instance, “from he” does not sound well; it must be “from
him”, though “him” is not the object of a sentence here.
The Quenya noun-forms so far discussed (whether singular, plural or dual)
are examples of the nominative case. The most important grammatical func-
tion of the nominative is that this is the form a noun has when it functions
as the subject of a verb. In Lesson Five, we very brieﬂy touched on another
form of the noun – the accusative case, which is the form a noun assumes
when it is the object of a verb. Modern English does not preserve any distinc-
tion between nominative and accusative in nouns (though such a distinction
persists in parts of the pronoun table, like nominative “he” vs. accusative
“him” in our examples above). English nouns do not change their form de-
pendent on whether the noun is the subject or the object of the sentence
– and neither do nouns in Third Age Quenya. Tolkien imagined an archaic
form of Quenya, “Book Quenya”, that did have an accusative case distinct
in form from the nominative. The noun “ship” would be cirya (pl. ciryar) if
it was used as the subject of a sentence, but ciry´
a (pl. ciryai) if it appeared
as the object: nominative vs. accusative. However, the distinct accusative
disappeared from the language as spoken in Middle-earth; the forms cirya
(pl. ciryar) came to be used both as subject and object. So either you can
say that in Third Age Quenya, the nominative and the accusative cases have
come to be identical in form, or you can say that the nominative has taken
over the functions of the distinct accusative so that in eﬀect, there is no
accusative anymore. It boils down to exactly the same thing.
But as far as we know, the accusative was the only Quenya case that was
lost among the Exiles. The remaining cases, in addition to the nominative,
are the genitive, the possessive, the dative, the allative, the ablative, the
locative, and the instrumental. (I should add that learning the form and
function of the cases is more important than learning their Latin names.)
There is also a mysterious case which Tolkien listed in the Plotz Letter, but
171


without discussing its name or use – so there is little I can say about it here.
In Lessons 11–16, we will work our way through the list of Quenya cases,
discussing their functions and how they are formed. Precisely because we
have the blessed Plotz Letter, we are now on somewhat more solid ground
than we usually ﬁnd ourselves upon when discussing Quenya grammar.
(Tolkien really should have sent Dick Plotz a list of pronouns and verb
forms as well!)
11.2
The Genitive
We will start our discussion of the Quenya cases with the few Quenya noun
forms that actually have a direct English equivalent (sort of). Where Quenya
has nine or ten noun cases, English has only two: nominative and genitive.
The nominative we have already discussed: In English as in Exilic Quenya,
a noun appears in the nominative when it is the subject or the object of a
noun. In both languages, the nominative singular may well be considered the
simplest form of the noun. There is no special ending or other inﬂectional
element to signal that “this is a nominative form”; rather it is the absence
of any such element that tells us what case the noun is.
All the other cases – or in English, the one other case – do display spe-
cial endings, though. The one noun case of modern English, except for the
nominative, is the genitive. (Please notice the spelling; I am tired of seeing
“genetive” on certain mailing lists.) In the singular, it is formed by adding
the ending ’s to the noun, e.g. girl’s from girl. In the plural, this ending nor-
mally merges with the plural ending -s, but its theoretical presence is hinted
at in writing by means of an apostrophe (girls’ for **girls’s. . . Gollum would
have loved the latter form).
The grammatical function of this case ought to be familiar enough to
anyone who is capable of reading this text; already in Lesson Two, we brieﬂy
touched on this “ownership form”. As stated in my handy Oxford Advanced
Learner’s Dictionary of Current English, the genitive case is used to indicate
“source or possession”. In a combination like the girl’s doll, the genitive
case is used to coordinate two nouns so as to indicate that the former is
the owner or possessor of the latter. (This latter word which the genitive
form connects with, like “doll” in our example, is sometimes said to be
governed by the genitive. Conversely, the genitive form itself may be said to
be “dependent on” this other word; this is Tolkien’s wording in UT:317.) The
English genitive does not necessarily connote “ownership” in the strictest
sense, but may also be used to describe other kinds of “belonging”, such as
family relationships – e.g. the girl’s mother. As for the genitive suggesting
source, we can think of such phrases as the architect’s drawings (the drawings
made by the architect, not necessarily owned by him, but originating with
him). The genitive noun may not even denote a sentient being, e.g. Britain’s
172


ﬁnest artists (the ﬁnest artists coming from/living in Britain). The latter
example may also be termed genitive of location; Britain’s ﬁnest artists are
the ﬁnest artists located in Britain.
The noun a genitive form is dependent on may well be another genitive,
which in turn refers to a third noun – e.g. “the queen’s sister’s house”.
In principle we can string up an inﬁnite number of genitives (“the king’s
father’s aunt’s brother’s dog’s. . . [etc. etc.]) – though it should not come
as a great shock to anyone that people who care about style and legibility
normally won’t push this too far.
Somewhat like adjectives, genitives can be used both attributively and
as predicates. All the examples above are examples of attributive genitives,
directly teamed up with a noun which the genitive is then dependent on. A
genitive would however function as a predicate in a sentence like the book is
Peter’s. But rather than using genitives as predicates, English often resorts
to circumlocutions (like the book belongs to Peter).
Quite often, English does not use a genitive, but instead employs a phrase
involving a preposition – predominantly of, e.g. the ﬁnest artists of Britain
rather than Britain’s ﬁnest artists. In some contexts, “of”-constructions are
actually preferred to genitives, e.g. the end of the road rather than the road’s
end.
So what about Quenya? The functions of English genitives, as well as
English “of”-constructions, are covered by two Quenya noun cases; we will
discuss the other relevant case in the next lesson. The functions of the case
normally referred to as the Quenya genitive are somewhat more limited than
the functions of the English genitive. But ﬁrst of all, let us discuss how the
Quenya genitive is formed.
The basic Quenya genitive ending is -o. Starting from nouns that should
be well known to the student by now, we can derive genitives like arano
“king’s”, t´
ario “queen’s”, vend¨
eo “maiden’s”. If the noun ends in -o al-
ready, the genitive ending normally becomes “invisible”. In UT:8 we have
ciryamo for “mariner’s”. This is our sole attestation of this noun, but
there is no reason to doubt that its nominative form “mariner” is like-
wise ciryamo (this word is obviously derived from cirya “ship”, and the
masculine/personal ending -mo [WJ:400] is well attested elsewhere: hence
cirya-mo = “ship-person”). A name like Ulmo could be both nominative
“Ulmo” and genitive “Ulmo’s”; the context must decide how the form is
to be understood. (However, in the case of nouns in -o that have special
stem-forms in -u, like curo, curu- “skillful device”, we would probably see
curuo as the genitive form.)
Nouns ending in -a lose this vowel when the genitive ending -o is added:
Since Quenya phonology does not permit the combination ao, it is simpliﬁed
to o. For instance, Nam´
ari¨
e demonstrates that the genitive “Varda’s” is
Vardo, not **Vardao. It follows, then, that a few otherwise distinct nouns
coincide in the genitive; for instance, it would seem that anta “face” and
173


anto “mouth” both have the genitive form anto. The context must be taken
into account to determine which noun is meant.
In the plural, the genitive ending -o is expanded to -on (as we shall see
later, the plural marker -n occurs in several of the Quenya case endings).
This ending -on is added to the simplest (nominative) plural form of the
noun, in -r or -i. Hence an r-plural like aldar “trees” has the genitive plu-
ral aldaron “trees’, of trees” – whereas an i-plural like eleni “stars” has
the genitive form elenion “stars’, of stars”. (The normal stress rules still
apply, so while eleni is accented on the ﬁrst syllable, the stress must fall
on -len- in the longer form elenion.) Both of these are attested in LotR:
Nam´
ari¨
e has r´
amar aldaron for “wings of trees” (a poetic circumlocution
for “leaves”), and Frodo speaking in tongues in Cirith Ungol referred to
E¨
arendil as ancalima elenion, “brightest of stars”.
A prominent example of a genitive plural is the very title of the Silmar-
illion, formed from the nominative plural Silmarilli “Silmarils”. This title
makes good sense considering that it is properly only one half of a longer
genitive phrase, found on the title page following the Ainulindal¨
e and the
Valaquenta: Quenta Silmarillion, “The History of the Silmarils”. As is
already evident, a Quenya genitive is often best rendered as an English of -
construction, not as an English genitive with the ending -’s or -s’: “Stars’
brightest” or “the Silmarils’ History” would not be good English.
As for dual genitive, Tolkien indicated that its ending is -to, combining
the dual ending -t with the basic genitive ending -o. In the Plotz letter,
Tolkien used the example ciryato, “of a couple of ships”. There is one
uncertainty here, not addressed in Plotz: Should the ending be -to also in
the case of the nouns that have dual forms in -u rather than -t? Or would
the u simply replace t here, so that such nouns have dual genitives in -uo
instead? Concretely: if the nominative “(the) Two Trees” is Aldu, should
the genitive “of (the) Two Trees” be Alduto or Alduo? A form like Alduto
would have a double dual marker, both u and t, but then attested plural
genitives likewise include double plural markers (elenion, aldaron). Even
so, I am not ready to rule out the possibility that genitives in -u should have
genitives in -uo, e.g. i cala Alduo for “the light of (the) Two Trees”. But
since published material allows no certain conclusions in this matter, I have
simply avoided the problem in the exercises below.
The special “stem forms” of some nouns are relevant for the formation of
genitives as well. From r´
a (r´
av-) “lion” we would have the genitive r´
avo
“lion’s”; from n´
ıs (niss-) “woman” we would have nisso “woman’s”. The
plural forms would be r´
avion “lions’, of lions” and nission “women’s, of
women” – cf. the nominative plurals r´
avi, nissi. I am not quite sure about
the dual forms; perhaps we can have r´
aveto, nisseto (an -e- intruding
before the ending -to so that impossible consonant clusters do not arise; see
later lessons regarding attested examples of an extra -e- being slipped in
like this).
174


So far the formation of the genitive; now we must return to its function. In
English, the genitive very often indicates who owns what, as in “the man’s
house”. Indeed this is the main function of the English genitive. However,
the Quenya genitive case is not normally used to describe simple ownership
of things. Tolkien expressly noted that properly this case was “not [used] as
a ‘possessive’, or adjectivally to describe qualities” (WJ:368).
To understand its function it is often useful to bear in mind its ultimate
derivation. Tolkien explained that “the source of the most used ‘genitive’
inﬂection of Quenya” was an ancient adverbial or “prepositional” element
basically meaning from or from among. According to WJ:368, it originally
had the form ho, or as an element added to nouns, -hˆ
o. The latter was the
direct source of the Quenya case ending -o (plural -on). But according to
the Etymologies, Quenya also had a regular preposition ho “from”, and in
WJ:368 Tolkien mentions h´
o- “from, oﬀ” as a verbal preﬁx, e.g. in h´
otuli-
“come away” or literally “from-come”.
Even the case ending -o may occasionally express “from”, the most basic
meaning of the primitive element ho. In the prose Nam´
ari¨
e, we have the
line Varda . . . ortan¨
e m´
aryat Oioloss¨
eo, “Varda . . . raised her hands
from Oioloss¨
e” (essentially the same in the version in LotR, but with a more
complicated, “poetic” word order). The translation in LotR goes “Varda . . .
from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands” – Oioloss¨
e “Ever-white”
being a name of Taniquetil, the great mountain of the Blessed Realm where
Manw¨
e and Varda dwell.
However, Oioloss¨
eo is our sole example of the Quenya genitive being
used with such a meaning. (For “from”, Quenya regularly uses another case
– the ablative, to be discussed in a later lesson.) Normally, the ending -o
is seen to have acquired other, more abstract meanings. Nonetheless, one
important function of the Quenya genitive still clearly reﬂect the idea of
something coming “from” something or someone else: The Quenya genitive
can be used to describe the source, origin or former possessor of some-
thing – so-called “derivative genitives” (WJ:369). Tolkien explained that
r´
oma Orom¨
eo “Orom¨
e’s horn” refers to a horn coming from Orom¨
e, not a
horn that Orom¨
e still has, or still had at the time that is being considered
(WJ:168). Likewise, lamb¨
e Eldaron could not be used for “the language
of the Eldar”, for this would mean “the language coming from the Eldar”;
Tolkien added that such a wording would only be valid “in a case where
the whole language was adopted by another people” (WJ:368–369). In light
of this, the genitive phrase Vardo tellumar “Varda’s domes” in Nam´
ari¨
e
may not necessarily imply that the heavenly “domes” were somehow owned
by Varda, but rather that she made them, that they originated with her.
Tolkien also listed “from among” as one of the meanings of the primitive
element ho, and this meaning is discernable in Quenya examples of parti-
tive genitive, the genitive indicating what something or someone is part of.
In the phrase E¨
arendil Elenion Ancalima “E¨
arendil brightest of stars”
175


(Letters:385), the words elenion ancalima actually imply “the brightest
one among the stars”: After his mythical transformation, E¨
arendil carrying
the Silmaril is himself one of the stars, as indicated by the chapter The Mir-
ror of Galadriel in Volume One of LotR (“E¨
arendil, the Evening Star, most
beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. . . ”)
It seems that a partitive genitive can denote what something is part of
in a wholly physical sense as well: In a phrase translated “the hands of the
Powers”, F´
ıriel’s Song uses the plural genitive Valion for “of the Powers”
(sc. “of the Valar” – as indicated by the Etymologies, entry bal, Vali is
a valid alternative to Valar as the plural form of Vala). The hands of
the Valar, whenever they are incarnated, are physically part of the Valar
themselves.
The relationship between a place and something located in that place
can also be expressed by means of the genitive case (cf. our own example
“Britain’s ﬁnest artists”). Nam´
ari¨
e has Calaciryo m´
ıri for “Calacirya’s
jewels = the jewels of Calacirya” (Calacirya “Light-cleft” being a place in
the Blessed Realm; notice that as in the case of Vardo “Varda’s”, the geni-
tive ending -o swallows up the ﬁnal -a). Perhaps this can also be analyzed as
a partitive genitive, if something located in a place is somehow considered a
part of that place. A more abstract, but perhaps basically similar construc-
tion is found in C´
ırion’s Oath: Elenna·n´
or¨
eo alcar “the glory of the land
of Elenna” or literally “(the) Elenna-land’s glory”. If we don’t perceive the
alcar or glory as being somehow “located” in Elenna (= N´
umenor), we must
think of it as emanating from Elenna, so that the genitive denotes source.
(See the next lesson concerning the comparable case alcar Orom¨
eo.)
Family relationships are denoted by the genitive case. In Treebeard’s
Greeting to Celeborn and Galadriel occurs the genitive phrase vanim´
alion
nostari, “parents of beautiful children” (Letters:308) or more literally “be-
getters of fair ones” (SD:73) – vanim´
ali meaning “fair ones” (genitive pl.
vanim´
alion) and nostari meaning “begetters”. One could also argue that
this example shows that a noun denoting some kind of agent, and another
noun denoting the one whom this agent does something to, can be coor-
dinated by means of the genitive case (the “fair ones” were begotten by
the begetters). Whatever the case, we have other examples of family rela-
tionships described by means of a genitive. In the Silmarillion Index, entry
“Children of Il´
uvatar”, we learn that this is a translation of H´
ıni Il´
uvataro.
Since Il´
uvatar (“All-father”) is a title of God, this example is somewhat pro-
found, but the genitive case would certainly also be used in such phrases as
“the king’s sons” (probably i arano yondor). As long as the genitive case
describes parents’ relationship to their oﬀspring, we could analyze the con-
structions as derivative genitives, parents being the physical origin of their
children. But in the example Indis i·Ciryamo “the Mariner’s Wife” (UT:8),
the genitive unquestionably describes a family relationship and nothing else,
since the “Mariner” is not in any way the source or origin of his wife.
176


Perhaps we can generalize even further and say that relationships between
people can be described by the Quenya genitive case. In WJ:369, Tolkien
indicated that the genitive would be used in such a phrase as Elw¨
e, Aran
Sindaron “Elw¨
e [= Thingol], King of the Sindar [Grey-elves]”. Here the
relationship is that between a ruler and the ruled. The same construction
could however be used with reference to the area that is ruled: “King of
Lestan´
or¨
e” would be Aran Lestan´
or¨
eo (Lestan´
or¨
e being the Quenya name
of the land called Doriath in Sindarin). The genitive case may also refer to
things that are ruled: In a booklet which accompanied an exhibition at the
Marquette University Archives in September 1983, Catalogue of an Exhibit
of the Manuscripts of JRRT, Taum Santoski presented Tolkien’s Quenya
translation of the title “Lord of the Rings”: Heru i Million, which is heru
“lord” + i “the” + what is probably the plural genitive of a noun mill¨
e
“ring”, not otherwise attested. In the LotR itself, the Quenya word for “ring”
is given as corma instead, Frodo and Sam being hailed as Cormacolindor
or Ring-bearers (this word occurring in the Cormallen Praise). For “Lord
of the Rings” we might therefore have expected Heru i Cormaron, but
anyhow, the phrase Heru i Million conﬁrms that the genitive case can be
used to describe the relationship between a ruler and the ruled (people, area
or thing).
One of the most abstract meanings the genitive case may take on is of =
about, concerning, as in Quenta Silmarillion “the History of (= concern-
ing) the Silmarils”. Another attested example is quental¨
e Noldoron “the
history of the Noldor” (VT39:16). It may well be that the genitive can be
used in this sense also in connection with verbs like nyar- “tell, relate” or
quet- “speak”, e.g. nyarnen i Eldo “I told about the Elf” or i Naucor
quetir alt¨
e harmaron “the Dwarves speak of great treasures”. We lack
attested examples, though.
Sometimes the precise meaning of a genitive is diﬃcult to clearly deﬁne.
In the famous greeting elen s´
ıla l´
umenn’ omentielvo, “a star shines upon
the hour of our meeting” or literally “. . . our meeting’s hour”, the genitive
simply coordinates the nouns “meeting” and “hour” to indicate that the
“meeting” took place in the “hour”. In the phrase Heren Istarion “Or-
der of Wizards” (UT:388), one may ask whether the genitive Istarion “of
Wizards” implies that the order was founded by wizards, that it belongs to
wizards, that it is made up of wizards, that it organizes or controls (or even
is controlled by) wizards, etc. In all likelihood, several or all of these shades
of meaning could be involved at the same time.
Also consider this passage from LotR, in the chapter The Houses of Heal-
ing in the third volume:
Thereupon the herb-master entered. ‘Your lordship asked for
kingsfoil, as the rustics name it,’ he said, ‘or athelas in the noble
tongue, or to those who know somewhat of the Valinorean. . . ’
177


‘I do so,’ said Aragorn, ‘and I care not whether you say now as¨
ea
aranion or kingsfoil, so long as you have some.’
So as¨
ea aranion is the Quenya (or “Valinorean”) for “kingsfoil”, the herb
called athelas in Sindarin. The word as¨
ea refers to some kind of helpful or
beneﬁcial plant, but what precise meaning does the genitive plural aranion
“of kings” express here? The kings didn’t own or originate the kingsfoil; it
was merely used by them for healing purposes. Unless this is comparable to a
Calaciryo m´
ıri-construction because the kingsfoil was physically with the
kings when they used it for healing (“life to the dying / In the king’s hand
lying!”), we must conclude that the genitive can also be used to indicate
rather ill-deﬁned states of “belonging”, or mere association.
Word order: In the prose version of Nam´
ari¨
e, Tolkien placed a genitive
in front of the noun it is dependent on: Aldaron lassi = literally “trees’
wings”, ´
omaryo l´
ırinen = literally “in her voice’s song”, Calaciryo m´
ıri
= literally “Calacirya’s jewels” – cf. the interlinear translation in RGEO:66–
67. (It should be noted that aldaron lassi was altered from lassi al-
daron in the “poetic” version in LotR.) Above the entire “prose” version,
Tolkien also placed the superscript Altariello naini¨
e, “Altariel’s (= Gal-
adriel’s) lament”. Cirion’s Oath displays the same word order: N´
or¨
eo alcar
“the glory of the land” or literally “(the) land’s glory”, Elendil vorondo
voronw¨
e “the faith of Elendil the Faithful” or literally “Elendil (the) Faith-
ful’s faith” (the genitive ending being attached to the last word in the phrase
Elendil voronda “E. [the] Faithful”; as usual, the ending displaces a ﬁnal
-a). In LotR we also have elenion ancalima for “stars’ brightest [one]” =
“the brightest [one] of [the] stars”. So in normal prose, should the genitive
always precede, just like the English genitive in ’s?
Not necessarily, it would seem. Most attested Quenya genitives follow the
noun they are dependent on, with the same word order as an English of -
construction. In the case of most of these attestations, we have no reason
to suppose the word order is particularly “poetic”: Quenta Silmarillion
“History of the Silmarils”, Heru i Million “Lord of the Rings”, l´
umenn’
omentielvo “on the hour of our meeting”, as¨
ea aranion “as¨
ea [helpful
plant] of kings” (kingsfoil; the two latter examples are from LotR), H´
ıni
Il´
uvataro “Children of Il´
uvatar” (Silmarillion Index), mannar Valion
“into the hands of the Powers” (F´
ıriel’s Song), Heren Istarion “Order
of Wizards” (UT:388), Pel´
ori Valion “Fencing Heights of the Vali [Valar]”
(MR:18), aran Sindaron “King of the Sindar” (WJ:369), Aran Lesta-
n´
or¨
eo “King of Doriath” (ibid.), i equessi R´
umilo “the sayings of R´
umil”
(WJ:398), lamb¨
e Eldaron or lamb¨
e Quendion “the language of the
Elves” (WJ:368/PM:395), Rithil-Anamo “Ring of Doom” (WJ:401).
Where Tolkien rendered such a construction by employing an English gen-
itive in -’s, he must of necessity reverse the Quenya word order: Indis
i·Ciryamo “The Mariner’s Wife” (UT:8).
178


One potential misunderstanding may be mentioned here: Occasionally
people are seen to be completely seduced by English of -constructions, think-
ing that the genitive ending -o should appear at the same place in the phrase
as the English preposition of does. Therefore they end up attaching the gen-
itive ending to the wrong word in an hopeless attempt to copy the English
order of all the elements in the phrase. Ask ten people to translate “the glory
of Aman” into a Quenya genitive phrase, and it is a good bet that several
of them will come up with something like i alcaro Aman, which actually
means “the glory’s Aman” or “Aman of the glory”! What we want is either
Amano alcar (think “Aman’s glory”) or (i) alcar Amano.
As for the word order employed when a preposition is used in conjunction
with a genitive phrase, the prose Nam´
ari¨
e provides the strange example
Vardo nu luini tellumar. Tolkien translated this as “under Varda’s blue
domes”. As we see, the Quenya wording is literally “Varda’s under blue
domes”, the preposition following the genitive noun – a most unexpected
order, especially considering that this is supposed to be normal prose. Yet the
prose Nam´
ari¨
e also has ve aldaron r´
amar for “like the wings of trees” (or
literally “like trees’ wings”). Here the word order is exactly what we would
expect, namely preposition + genitive + the noun it governs (not **aldaron
ve r´
amar or whatever!) It is almost tempting to assume that Vardo nu
luini tellumar is simply an error for ?nu Vardo luini tellumar. At this
stage at least, I would always use the “English-style” word-order exempliﬁed
by ve aldaron r´
amar. Perhaps Vardo nu luini tellumar is an example
of the exceedingly esoteric syntax preferred by the Eldar, whose thoughts
are not like those of Mortal Men. . . or perhaps it is just a typo. We must
await the publication of more material.
The use of the article: A genitive determines the noun it is dependent
upon, just like the deﬁnite article does: Indis i·Ciryamo does mean “the
Mariner’s Wife” = “the Wife of the Mariner”. It cannot be interpreted “a
wife of the mariner” in an indeﬁnite or undetermined sense, even though
the deﬁnite article i is missing before the noun indis “wife, bride”. Same
with lamb¨
e Quendion “the language of the Elves” (PM:395, emphasis
added); this cannot be interpreted “a language of the Elves”, for lamb¨
e is
determined by the genitive Quendion. Cf. English “the Elves’ language”
= “the [not a] language of the Elves”, even though there is no “the” before
“language” in a phrase like “the Elves’ language”. One must understand
that while the ﬁrst noun of an English of -construction may or may not be
deﬁnite and accordingly receives the appropriate article (the or a), a Quenya
noun connecting with a following genitive is always determined, whether or
not the article i is used. The system is actually the same as in English, with
one minor complication added: whereas an English genitive always precedes
the noun it is dependent on, a Quenya genitive may come after this noun
as well. The latter word order inevitably makes one think of English of -
constructions, but they are strictly not comparable as far as grammar is
179


concerned – even though Quenya genitive phrases are often best rendered
as English of -constructions.
Where the genitive follows the noun it is dependent upon, the use of
the deﬁnite article before this noun is apparently optional. The noun is
deﬁnite anyway, so including the article is in a way superﬂuous; yet we
have the examples i arani Eldaron “the kings of the Eldar” (WJ:369) and
i equessi R´
umilo “the sayings of R´
umil” (WJ:398). Equessi R´
umilo,
arani Eldaron without the article would have meant precisely the same
thing. Conversely, the phrase indis i ciryamo “the mariner’s wife” could
presumably have been expanded to read i indis i ciryamo “the wife of the
mariner”, again without altering the meaning.
No attested example of a preceding genitive is followed by an article.
But if we can choose freely between i equessi R´
umilo and just equessi
R´
umilo, perhaps this principle would still apply if the genitive is moved to
the beginning of the phrase? R´
umilo equessi “R´
umil’s sayings” is certainly
a valid wording, but what about R´
umilo i equessi? Would this be equally
possible, or would it sound just as weird as “R´
umil’s the sayings” in English?
I, for one, would avoid this uncertain and unattested construction.
A few prepositions govern the genitive case. It is said that ´
u “without”
is normally followed by genitive, Tolkien mentioning the example ´
u calo
“without light” (VT39:14). This calo would seem to be the genitive form of
a noun cala “light” (as in Calaquendi “Light-elves” or Calacirya “Light-
cleft”).
Summary of Lesson Eleven:
The Quenya noun is inﬂected for a number of cases, special noun-forms which
clarify what function a noun has in a sentence. The forms so far discussed
are examples of the nominative case, used when a noun is the subject or the
object of a sentence (a distinct “object” case, the accusative, had formerly
occurred but fell out of use in Exilic Quenya). The Quenya genitive case
has the ending -o (displacing a ﬁnal -a, where such is present); the plural
form is -on (added to the nominative plural), whereas dual genitives receive
the ending -to (but nouns with nominative dual forms in -u would possibly
have genitive duals in -uo rather than -uto). The noun governed by the
genitive can come either before or after it; R´
umilo equessi or (i) equessi
R´
umilo would work equally well for “R´
umil’s sayings/the sayings of R´
umil”.
The Quenya genitive properly indicates source or origin (including former
possessors), but also covers most relationships between people (like family
relationships), as well as the relationship between a ruler and the ruled
(people or territory). “Xo Y” or “Y Xo” may also imply “Y of X” in the
sense of Y being a physical part of X, or (if X is a plural word) Y being
one of X. Thus E¨
arendil is said to be elenion ancalima “stars’ brightest”
180


= “the brightest one of (/among) stars”. The relationship between a place
and something located in that place may also be expressed by means of
a genitive: Calaciryo m´
ıri “the jewels of Calacirya”. A genitive can also
express “of = about, concerning”, as in Quenta Silmarillion “the History
of the Silmarils”. Furthermore, the preposition ´
u “without” normally takes
the genitive case.

Lesson 12
The Possessive-Adjectival case. Verbal or Abstract nouns
and how they interact with the Genitive and Possessive
cases.
This lesson is mainly devoted to a case that by its function in many ways
complements the genitive case. But ﬁrst of all, let me say that there is no
easy answer to the question of what this case should be called. Tolkien listed
it in the Plotz Letter, but he did not name it. The case in -o or -on that
we discussed in the previous lesson is referred to simply as the “genitive”
in several sources. But in WJ:369, Tolkien refers to the forms in -o(n) as
“partitive-derivative genitives”, whereas the other case that we will now dis-
cuss is called a “possessive-adjectival [genitive]”. On the previous page, he
noted regarding the case with the ending -o(n) that “properly it was used
partitively, or to describe the source or origin, not as a ‘possessive’” (em-
phasis added). The context indicates that the other case that he went on to
describe is used as a “possessive”. So simply to have a some suitable desig-
nation of this case, I shall adopt the word possessive as its name. (Another
plausible term is “adjectival case”, which is also used by some students.)
12.1
The Possessive
By its function, this case – rather than the case in -o(n) which Tolkien nor-
mally terms the “genitive” when discussing Quenya grammar – corresponds
much better to the English genitive in -’s. Even so, in certain contexts this
case is also best translated using English of -constructions.
The possessive case is formed by adding the ending -va, e.g. Eldava as
the possessive form of Elda. In the case of a noun ending in a consonant, the
ending probably takes the form -wa instead. The assumption that the end-
ing -va appears in the variant form -wa after consonants is also supported
by this fact: The suﬃx -va is in origin a mere adjectival ending, found in
some common adjectives as well, and in such cases it is seen to appear as
-wa following a consonant – e.g. anwa “real, actual, true” or helwa “pale
blue”. In Primitive Elvish, the ending had the form -wˆ
a, but in Quenya, w
183


normally became v when intervocalic (occurring between vowels). Cf. an-
other common adjective displaying this ending, tereva “ﬁne, acute”, which
word Tolkien noted had been terˆ
ewˆ
a in Primitive Elvish (see Etym., entry
ter, teres). Since most Quenya nouns end in a vowel, the w of -wˆ
a typi-
cally became intervocalic when this ending was added, and normally turned
into v (e.g. Eldˆ
a-wˆ
a, Eldawˆ
a becoming Eldava, just like terˆ
ewˆ
a became
tereva). But if we combine this ending with a noun ending in a consonant,
e.g. atar “father” (unchanged since Primitive Elvish), atar-wˆ
a would pre-
sumably produce Quenya atarwa, original w remaining w because it is not
here intervocalic.
The Plotz Letter lists no dual forms of the possessive case, but I can’t
imagine why such forms should not exist. Even so, I won’t construct any
exercises involving these slightly hypothetical forms, but presumably the
simple suﬃx -va would be used after a dual form in -u – e.g. Alduva as the
possessive form of Aldu “Two Trees”. The more frequent dual forms in -t
would likely have possessive forms in -twa, a dual like ciryat “a couple of
ships” becoming ciryatwa (accented on the second-to-last syllable because
of the consonant cluster tw).
Just like the Plotz Letter lists no dual form of the possessive case, Tolkien
mentioned no plural form either – which fact led some investigators to con-
clude that this case has no plural at all! But other material does indicate
that such a form exists (suggesting that we can also feel free to extrapolate
a dual form as we tried to do above: the Plotz Letter does not necessarily
include everything). In WJ:368 Tolkien indicates that the possessive has a
plural form in -iva, combining the simple ending -va with the plural marker
-i. In this case, this ending is used even if the possessive suﬃx is added
to words that would normally have nominative plurals in -r, like Eldar:
The plural possessive is not **Eldarva or **Eldarwa or whatever, but
Eldaiva, attested in the phrase lamb¨
e Eldaiva “language of the Eldar”
(WJ:369). The plural form -iva is said to be an innovation in Quenya, not
a form inherited from older stages of Elvish.
When the initial vowel of the ending -iva merges with the last vowel of
the noun to produce a diphthong, like ai in Elda + iva = Eldaiva, this
diphthong of course receives the stress (eld-AI-va). Most nouns in -¨
e would
at an older stage have behaved in a similar way, a diphthong ei arising; the
plural possessive of lass¨
e “leaf” may at one point have been lasseiva (for
even older ?lasseiwˆ
a, if such a form was ever in use). But the diphthong
ei eventually became long ´
ı in Quenya, so perhaps the current form was
lass´
ıva – with a long ´
ı still attracting the stress. In the Plotz Letter, such a
long ´
ı is observed in the plural form of another case: lass´
ınen as the plural
instrumental, to be discussed in a later lesson.
It is not quite clear what would happen when the ending -iva is added to
a noun already ending in -i, like t´
ari “queen”, or a noun with a stem-form
in -i, like l´
om¨
e (l´
omi-) “night” (SD:415). Possibly the two i’s would merge
184


into a long ´
ı, so that “of queens” or “of nights” is something like ?t´
ar´
ıva,
?l´
om´
ıva – whereas the singular forms “of a queen” and “of a night” must
be t´
ariva, l´
omiva. (The pronunciation would be markedly diﬀerent: these
singular forms are accented on the ﬁrst syllable, the third from the end, while
the plural forms would be accented on the second-to-last syllable because
of the long vowel that suddenly turns up there – if the ﬁnal -i of the noun
and the ﬁrst vowel of the ending -iva do indeed merge into a long ´
ı.) But
it is also possible that a form like t´
ariva has to do duty for both singular
and plural, so that one must rely on the context to distinguish “of a queen”
from “of queens”.
There are a few more things to say about the formation of the possessive
case (see “Various notes” below), but we will now return to its function.
This is the case you use to describe simple possession, the typical func-
tion of the English genitive. In the previous lesson, we have described how
the Quenya genitive is rather used to indicate source or origin, not simple
ownership. If the genitive describes the relationship between owners and
the things they own, we are dealing with former rather than current owner-
ship. Tolkien nicely explained this by contrasting the genitive and possessive
cases, and we can well aﬀord to quote him, recapitulating the function of
the genitive in the process:
’Possession’ was indicated by the adjectival ending -va. . . Thus
‘Orome’s horn’ was r´
oma Orom´
eva (if it remained in his posses-
sion) . . . but [the genitive phrase] r´
oma Orom¨
eo meant ‘a horn
coming from Orome’, e.g. as a gift, in circumstances where the
recipient, showing the gift with pride, might say ‘this is Orome’s
horn’. If he said ‘this was Orome’s horn’, he would say Orom´
eva.
Similarly [the genitive phrase] lambe Eldaron would not be used
for ‘the language of the Eldar’ (unless conceivably in a case where
the whole language was adopted by another people), which is
[rather] expressed . . . by . . . lambe Eldaiva. [WJ:368–369]
So the possessive case may indicate simple ownership at the time that is
being considered (past or present – whereas origin, or former possession, is
indicated by the genitive case). An example from the Silmarillion is Mindon
Eldali´
eva, the “Tower of the Eldali¨
e [= Elf-people]”, meaning simply a
tower owned by the Eldali¨
e. (Certainly they had also originated it, but they
were still its owners, so a genitive would be less appropriate.) We would
also have such phrases as (i) coa i Eldava “the Elf’s house”/”the house
of the Elf”, i parmar i vend´
ıva “the books of the maidens”, i m´
ıri i
Naucoiva “the jewels of the Dwarves”. As for this word order, it should
be observed that the noun which receives the possessive ending appears as
the last word of the possessive phrase in all attested instances: The noun
it governs (denoting the thing that is owned) comes before it. It may well
185


be that one could reverse the word order and say (for instance) ?i Eldava
coa with the same word order as in English: “the Elf’s house”. However, I
would avoid this construction until we have it attested in Tolkien’s papers.
The noun governed by the possessive form does not receive the arti-
cle in most of our attested examples; it is already suﬃciently determined:
R´
oma Orom´
eva is not indeﬁnite “a horn of Orom¨
e’s”, as if it is ﬁrst in-
troduced into the story, or it is implied that Orom¨
e had other horns as
well. (According to Tolkien, this meaning would be expressed by means of
a “loose compound”, the words simply being juxtaposed without involv-
ing any case endings at all: Orom¨
e r´
oma = “an Orom¨
e horn”.) R´
oma
Orom´
eva is “Orom¨
e’s horn” = “the horn of Orom¨
e”, r´
oma being deter-
mined by Orom´
eva. But we could certainly slip in an explicit article and
say i r´
oma Orom´
eva without changing the meaning; as demonstrated in
the previous lesson, both constructions are equally valid in a phrase involv-
ing a genitive noun. An attested example involving the possessive case is the
phrase i arani Eldaiv¨
e “the Kings of the Eldar” (WJ:369; this primarily
means “those kings in a particular assembly who were Elvish”, whereas i
arani Eldaron with a genitive means “those among the Eldar who were
kings”, or simply “the kings ruling the Eldar”). The article could probably
be omitted without changing the meaning: Arani Eldaiv¨
e would still mean
“the kings of the Eldar”, the possessive form Eldaiv¨
e determining arani
anyway. (As for why the ending -iva here appears as -iv¨
e, see below; this
probably contradicts some evidence from LotR, so we may read Eldaiva
instead.)
The possessive case does not always indicate “possession” in the narrowest
sense, but may also describe somebody’s relationship to their more-or-less
abstract attributes or properties. In such contexts, one can use the genitive
as well. Tolkien mentioned that “the splendour (glory) of Orom¨
e” could be
expressed in two ways: One may use the possessive-adjectival case and say
alcar Orom´
eva, referring to Orom¨
e’s alcar or splendour as a permanent
attribute of his. But one could also use the genitive case; the wording alcar
Orom¨
eo emphasizes that Orom¨
e is the source of the splendour. This could
refer to “his splendour as seen at the moment (proceeding from him) or at
some point in a narrative” – focusing on the moment rather than on some
permanent state (WJ:369). Cirion’s Oath uses the genitive in the phrase
Elenna·n´
or¨
eo alcar “the glory of the land of Elenna”. If one used the
possessive instead, to produce the wording (i) alcar Elenna·n´
oreva, it
would apparently put the emphasis on the “glory” of Elenna as a permanent
attribute of the land. In Middle-earth time, Cirion’s Oath was spoken long
after Elenna (N´
umenor) had been destroyed and its “glory” proven to be
rather less than permanent, so perhaps this would be inappropriate.
In our home-made example alcar Elenna·n´
oreva, we added the posses-
sive ending to a noun that does not denote a sentient being. This is hardly
improper, for we have such attested examples as Taur¨
e Huin´
eva “For-
186


est of Gloom” and Nurtal¨
e Valin´
oreva “Hiding of Valinor”. Where no
sentient is involved, the possessive case obviously takes on other shades of
meaning; no “ownership” can be involved, since things or substances can’t
own anything. Cf. for instance the ﬁrst example of this case that was ever
published, in Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR. Here we have yuldar . . . lisse-miruv´
oreva
for “draughts of [the] sweet mead” (in the prose Nam´
ari¨
e in RGEO:68, the
words are actually directly juxtaposed as yuldar lisse-miruv´
oreva; in the
poetic version in LotR, a number of other words intrude between the two
elements of this phrase). For decades, this was the sole available example
of the case in -va. Here, this case ending implies “(made) of”: The yuldar
or “draughts” consist of lisse-miruv´
or¨
e or “sweet mead”. Following this
example, two nouns like ri¨
e “crown” and telp¨
e “silver” can evidently be
combined as ri¨
e telpeva, “crown of silver”. It may be noted that in such
a case – the possessive noun denoting a material – the noun it governs is
not necessarily be determined by it (not “the crown of silver”). Otherwise,
yuldar lisse-miruv´
oreva would have to mean **“the draughts of sweet
mead”, but Tolkien did not translate it in this way. – Having only this one
example from Nam´
ari¨
e to work from, early researchers thought the case in
-va was what they called a “compositive” case denoting what something
consists of (is composed of). This usage should be noted, but we now know
that this is only one of the secondary functions of this case.
Yet the fact remains that the ending -va is in origin simply adjectival, so
this case may easily take on a “descriptive” function. Regarding the geni-
tive case in -o, Tolkien noted that properly it was NOT used “adjectivally
to describe qualities” (WJ:368): this is rather the function of the case in
-va. The example Taur¨
e Huin´
eva (Etym, entry phuy) apparently means
“Forest of Gloom”; cf. the nouns taur¨
e “forest” and huin¨
e “deep shadow,
gloom”. One may almost just as well treat huin´
eva as a regular adjective
and translate Taur¨
e Huin´
eva as “Gloomy Forest” or “Shadowy Forest”.
The idea is that the “forest” is characterized by “gloom”, so the case in -va
can describe what characterizes something or someone. This “characteris-
tic” may also be an abstract or action: In early material (LT1:14) we ﬁnd
the example Mar Vanwa Tyali´
eva “Cottage of Lost Play” – the mar or
“cottage” being characterized by vanwa tyali¨
e, “lost play” (one must read
the earliest Silmarillion manuscripts as reproduced in LT1 and LT2 to un-
derstand precisely what this refers to). It should however be noted that the
genitive case may also be used in such a context; in the late essay Quendi and
Eldar we have Rithil-Anamo for “Doom-ring” or more literally “Ring of
Doom” (WJ:401; the Old Quenya word rithil “ring, circle” would probably
become risil in Exilic Quenya). Rithil-Anamo does not refer to Sauron’s
Ring, but to the M´
ahanaxar, the circle where the Valar passed judgement.
The word anamo is not otherwise attested, but must be the genitive of
either anama or anan (with stem anam-); it apparently means “doom,
judgement, judging” – the activity characterizing or going on in the Circle
187


(Rithil). Perhaps the possessive case could have been used instead (?Rithil
Anam´
ava or ?Rithil Ananwa) without changing the meaning.
In some instances one may indeed be in doubt which case to use, the gen-
itive or the possessive; sometimes Tolkien’s own choice is slightly surprising.
He used the possessive in the phrase Noldo-quentasta Ingoldova “In-
goldo’s History of the Noldor” (VT39:16) – the Elf Ingoldo being the author
of this particular Noldo-quentasta or “Noldo-history”. Yet the emphasis is
hardly on the fact that Ingoldo owns this “Noldo-history” (unless copyright
was a big issue in Valinor). Ingoldo is just the author or originator, and for
this meaning we might expect the genitive case to be used instead, since it
frequently describes origin or source. Yet there may be certain conﬂicting
concerns here: Since the genitive case may also signify about, concerning
(as in Quenta Silmarillion), perhaps Noldo-quentasta Ingoldo with a
genitive instead could easily have been misunderstood as “the Noldo-history
about Ingoldo”.
Anyhow, in one attested example, Tolkien’s choice of case certainly
amounts to an outright contradiction of what he had written earlier, in the
essay Quendi and Eldar: We have quoted his explanation of why it would
normally be improper to use the genitive in a phrase like lamb¨
e Eldaron
“the language of the Eldar” – this would imply “the language coming from
the Eldar, later taken over by others”! One had to use the possessive case
instead: lamb¨
e Eldaiva. Yet Tolkien himself used lamb¨
e Quendion for
“the language of Elves” in a very late source (PM:395) – and Quendion is
unmistakably a plural genitive. The fact that Tolkien here uses another word
for “Elf” (Quend¨
e instead of Elda) can hardly make any diﬀerence: Ac-
cording to the system set out in Quendi and Eldar, we would expect lamb¨
e
Quend´
ıva, the possessive case being used of current ownership. Perhaps we
can resolve the contradiction in “internal” terms, appealing to a linguistic
development within the mythos: Tolkien noted that there was an increasing
tendency to prefer the genitive case, people sometimes using it instead of
the possessive case (WJ:369). So in “late usage” it would perhaps be more
natural to say lamb¨
e Quendion rather than lamb¨
e Quend´
ıva, the former
distinctions fading away. If one is in doubt which case to use, the genitive
or the possessive, it is probably best to pick the former.

Various notes
ﬁlling in some details
NOTE #1: Vowel-lengthening in the syllable preceding the case ending: The
observant student will have noted that sometimes, the last vowel of a noun
is lengthened when the ending -va is added. For instance, Eldali¨
e + va
produces Eldali´
eva with a long ´
e (which must then receive the stress, ac-
cording to the normal rules). Orom´
eva and tyali´
eva as the possessive forms
188


of the nouns Orom¨
e and tyali¨
e are other examples. Notice that the words
Eldali¨
e, Orom¨
e, tyali¨
e all end in two short syllables (containing neither
consonant clusters, diphthongs or long vowels). If the ending -va were added
after them and no further changes were made, the extra syllable provided
by this ending would make the stress move to what is now the third syllable
from the end (cf. the stress rules set out in Lesson One). This would result
in the rather awkward pronunciations **orOMeva, **eldaLIeva, **tyaLIeva.
So where the ending -va is added to a noun ending in two short syllables,
and there is no ﬁnal consonant, the vowel of the last of these syllables is
apparently lengthened to make sure that it will receive the stress: oroM ´
Eva,
eldali´
Eva, tyali ´
Eva. But if the noun ends in a consonant, there is never any
need to lengthen the vowel, for where we are dealing with a noun of such
a shape, the suﬃxing of the case ending (probably appearing as -wa) will
result in a consonant cluster which will make the stress move to the vowel be-
fore the new cluster anyhow. For instance, while a name like Menelmacar
(the Quenya name of Orion) is naturally accented on the third syllable from
the end because it ends in two short syllables, its possessive form Menel-
macarwa would be accented on -arw- because of the cluster rw here arising:
This cluster makes what is now the second-to-last syllable long, and therefore
it receives the stress.
It is unclear whether the system just sketched – the ﬁnal vowel of a noun
ending in two short syllables being lengthened before the ending -va – would
still be valid in the case of a word that only consists of these two short
syllables. Such words are stressed on the ﬁrst syllable when they occur by
themselves, e.g. li¨
e “people”. The example Eldali´
eva shows lengthening of
the ´
e, but li¨
e is here compounded, and Eldali¨
e without the case ending is
accented on the a. It may be that if li¨
e occurred by itself, its possessive form
would be lieva (accented on the ﬁrst syllable) rather than li´
eva (accented
on the ´
e). We cannot know. In the case of a word like Vala, my gut feeling
is that its possessive form should be Valava rather than ?Val´
ava. But since
there is no way of being certain, I will avoid these problems in the exercises
below.
Huin´
eva (instead of **huineva) as the possessive form of huin¨
e “sha-
dow, gloom” is however a puzzling example. For a while I actually thought
ﬁnal -¨
e is always lengthened before the ending -va, but the Plotz Letter
indicates that the possessive form of lass¨
e “leaf” is lasseva (not **lass´
eva).
If the ui of huin¨
e is counted as two syllables (u-i), not as a diphthong, this
example would conform with the rule set out above: hu-i-n¨
e would have
its ﬁnal vowel lengthened when -va is added, producing huin´
eva. But since
Tolkien explicitly stated that Quenya ui is a diphthong – hence pronounced
as one long syllable and not as two short ones – this explanation is not
satisfactory. Yet ui is supposed to be a diphthong in Sindarin as well, but in
one Sindarin poem, ui occurs where the poetic meter demands two syllables.
Perhaps ui, although a diphthong, is somehow “overlong” and sometimes
189


counts as two syllables, even though it is perceived as one syllable by the
ear. Bottom line is, if the case ending -va is to be added to a noun with
ui in its second-to-last syllable, the vowel in the ﬁnal syllable is apparently
lengthened before -va is suﬃxed. So the possessive form of nouns like cuil¨
e
“life” or tuima “sprout” should evidently be cuil´
eva, tuim´
ava.
As for the genitive ending -o, there is no similar lengthening when the
ending is to be added to a noun ending in two short syllables: The genitive
form of Orom¨
e is attested as Orom¨
eo, not **Orom´
eo (contrast possessive
Orom´
eva). The form Orom¨
eo must be accented on -rom-. It seems likely,
then, that nothing special happens when -o is added to a word like huin¨
e
either (genitive probably huin¨
eo, hardly ?huin´
eo). However, I should like
to see an attested example of what happens when the ending -o is added
to a noun ending in two short vowels in hiatus – most frequently -i¨
e, as in
Vali¨
e “female Vala”. ?Vali¨
eo would have to be accented on i, which sounds
rather awkward; the same goes for the plural form ?Valieron. I strongly
suspect that in such a case, the vowel in the syllable before the genitive
ending would be lengthened, thus attracting the stress: Vali´
eo, Vali´
eron.
But once again, there is no way of being certain; we must await further
publications.
NOTE #2: Special stem-forms of nouns: Where a noun has a special
stem-form, it would always appear when the genitive ending -o is added. The
genitive of n´
ıs (niss-) “woman” or talan (talam-) “ﬂoor” would be nisso
“woman’s” and talamo “ﬂoor’s”. Yet the ending -va or -wa for possessive
may sometimes produce more complex results. Adding -wa to a noun like
talan, talam- would probably result in talanwa, not **talamwa, since
mw regularly becomes nw in Quenya. Suﬃxing -wa to ﬁlit (ﬁlic-) “bird”
would result in ﬁlicwa all right, but this we must spell ﬁliqua according
to the normal conventions. I am not quite sure what the possessive form
of n´
ıs (niss-) “woman” should be. **Nisswa is certainly not a possible
Quenya word; perhaps we would see something like nisseva, an extra e
turning up before the ending to break up the impossible consonant cluster
(and following a vowel, we would regularly see -va instead of -wa). – The
“stem-form” of some nouns is simply a contraction, e.g. fern- as the stem of
feren “beech-tree”. Surely the genitive would be ferno, but the possessive
may well be ferenwa with no contraction, since other examples indicate
that such contraction does not occur before a consonant cluster (**fernwa
is not a possible Quenya word). Of course we could slip in an e here as well,
producing ?ferneva, but I would certainly put my money on ferenwa.
NOTE #3: A Tolkienian rule we can aﬀord to ignore (!): In WJ:407,
Tolkien states that the case derived by adding -va never lost it strong adjec-
tival connotations; he actually says that it “was and remained an adjective”.
As we remember from Lesson Four, adjectives in -a have plural forms in -¨
e
(for archaic -ai). According to what Tolkien says in WJ:407, a possessive
noun (with ending -va) that governs a plural word would agree with it in
190


number just like any other adjective, the ending -va turning into -v¨
e. For this
reason, he used i arani Eldaiv¨
e for “the Kings of the Eldar” in WJ:369:
Eldaiva “of the Eldar” becomes Eldaiv¨
e (archaic Eldaivai) to agree in
number with the plural noun it is dependent on, namely arani “kings”.
However, this may be one of the cases of Tolkien revising Elvish grammar
without noticing that his new ideas contradicted something he had already
published. For in Nam´
ari¨
e in LotR, we have yuldar . . . lisse-miruv´
oreva
for “draughts of sweet mead”, and Tolkien later conﬁrmed this construction
in The Road Goes Ever On. Since yuldar “draughts” is a plural word, lisse-
miruv´
oreva should have been lisse-miruv´
orev¨
e according to the system
Tolkien later set out in WJ:407. As I said, the likeliest “external” explanation
is simply that Tolkien introduced a new rule without noticing that he had
already published something that contradicted it. In “internal” terms, we
may perhaps assume that the possessive form was still perceived as a kind of
derived adjective in the older period, and therefore it also agreed in number
like regular adjectives. But as the Ages went by in Middle-earth, the forms
derived by means of the ending -va came to be perceived more strictly as
a noun case only, and by the late Third Age when Galadriel composed her
Lament, the adjective-style agreement in number had been abandoned. I do
not use it in the exercises I have made for this course.
12.3
Verbal or Abstract nouns
and how they interact with the genitive and possessive cases
We have earlier deﬁned nouns as words denoting things, whereas verbs are
words that denote actions – but we have also hinted that linguists would
ﬁnd such deﬁnitions rather simplistic. Some nouns do denote actions, and
they are appropriately called verbal nouns. Since such nouns may interact
with the genitive and possessive cases in a way that should be noted, this is
a good place to introduce them.
A verbal noun is derived from the stem of a verb; in English, the relevant
ending is -ing. (This is also the ending used to derive active participles,
but they are adjectives, not nouns; the forms merely happen to coincide in
English.) Singing is the verbal noun corresponding to the verb sing; in other
words, singing is the action you perform when you sing.
In Quenya, the stems of some primary verbs are the source of abstract for-
mations in -m¨
e; some of them seem to have been verbal nouns in origin. For
instance, whereas the verb “to love” is mel-, the noun “love” (or “loving”)
is melm¨
e. Some of these may take on more specialized meanings. Carm¨
e
is used for “art” (UT:439), though this is basically simply a kind of verbal
noun derived from the verb car- “make, do” – hence literally “making”. (See
below regarding oiencarm¨
e.)
Primary verbs may also receive the ending -i¨
e; the verb tyal- “to play”
191


corresponds to the abstract formation tyali¨
e “play, playing” (as noun; cf.
the Mar Vanwa Tyali´
eva or “Cottage of Lost Play” mentioned above).
Added to an A-stem verb, the ending -i¨
e makes the ﬁnal -a drop out; cf.
naina- “to lament” producing the abstract noun naini¨
e “a lament(ing)”.
Yet another frequent formation is to lengthen the stem-vowel of a primary
verb and add the ending -¨
e. The verb ser- “rest” corresponds to the abstract
noun s´
er¨
e “rest, repose, peace”. Very often, the nouns so derived have taken
on a somewhat more concrete meaning. From the verb sir- “to ﬂow” we
have s´
ır¨
e, which would basically refer to a “ﬂowing”, but this noun is used
= “river”. The noun n´
ut¨
e connects with the verb nut- “to tie”, but the
noun has developed beyond the full abstract “tying, binding” and has come
to signify “knot” instead. From lir- “to sing, chant” we have l´
ır¨
e, used for
“song” rather than just “singing, chanting”. Yet the underlying idea of a
verbal noun is often still discernible.
The stems of some A-stem verbs, especially in -ta, can also be used as
abstract nouns with no additions. Vanta- is the verb “to walk”, but vanta
is also used as an abstract: “a walk” (that is, “walking” considered as a
noun). Likewise, the verbs lanta- “to fall” corresponds to the noun lanta
“a fall(ing)”. However, the noun may also be lant¨
e, as in the name of the
song Noldolant¨
e or “Fall of the Noldor” mentioned in the Silmarillion. In
Quenya, abstract nouns indeed show a great preference for the ending -¨
e,
either alone or as part of a longer ending.
One such ending is -l¨
e, which seems to one of the most versatile Quenya
abstract suﬃxes. It may be that it can in principle be added to any A-
stem verb, and the resulting word is basically a verbal noun. The verb
laita- “to bless/praise” occurs in LotR (in the Cormallen Praise), and
the corresponding abstract noun laital¨
e “praise” or “praising” occurs in
UT:166, 436 (where reference is made to the Erulaital¨
e or “Praise of Eru”,
a N´
umen´
orean festival). In earlier lessons we have used the verb nurta- “to
hide”, which is actually only attested as a verbal noun nurtal¨
e “hiding” (see
below concerning the phrase Nurtal¨
e Valin´
oreva “Hiding of Valinor”).
Then let us return to the genitive and possessive cases. If you combine a
verbal noun (or an abstract formation that still clearly connects with a verb)
with a noun in the genitive case, it suggests that this noun is the “subject” of
the corresponding verb. An attested example is Altariello naini¨
e for “Gal-
adriel’s lament” (RGEO:66; the Quenya form of Galadriel’s name is Altariel
with stem Altariell-). The genitive Altariello “Galadriel’s” governing the
abstract noun naini¨
e “lament, lamenting” indicates that Galadriel is the
one who does the lamenting: subject genitive. Perhaps the phrase i equessi
R´
umilo “the sayings of R´
umil” (WJ:398) may also be analyzed in such a
way: R´
umil is the subject who originally “said” the “sayings”. An obvious
case is provided by the phrase Oiencarm¨
e Eruo “the One’s [Eru’s, God’s]
perpetual production” (MR:471). Eru is the one who does the “perpetual
production” (oi-en-carm¨
e = probably “ever-re-making”), and this is indi-
192


cated by the genitive form Eruo: subject genitive yet again.
Way back in Lesson Two, I pointed out the error contained in the title
of the fanzine Parma Eldalamberon; it should have been Parma El-
dalambion instead. I must now take aﬀair with the title of another (good!)
Tolkien-linguistic journal, Tyali¨
e Tyelelli´
eva. This was meant to signify
“Play of the Tyelelli¨
e” (a folk of little Elves). But since the Tyelelli¨
e are the
subject of the abstract noun “play” (the ones who do the playing), it would
probably have been better to use the genitive case here: perhaps Tyali¨
e
Tyelelli´
eo.
So far subject genitive; what about object genitive? This kind of geni-
tive is usually replaced by an of -construction in English: “the discovery of
America” = the discovery which America was the object of. Subject and
object genitive can even be combined in a phrase like “Columbus’ discovery
of America” (Columbus is the subject who does the discovery, America is
the object that is discovered).
Our one-and-only attested example of a Quenya object genitive seems
to indicate that for this meaning, Quenya uses the case in -va. This one
example is found in the Silmarillion, near the end of Chapter 11: Nurtal¨
e
Valin´
oreva, the “Hiding of Valinor” (Valin´
oreva is formed from Valin´
or¨
e,
an older variant of the name normally shortened as Valinor). The point
is that the Valar hid Valinor, so Valinor is the object of the nurtal¨
e or
“hiding”. If one used the genitive case instead, saying Nurtal¨
e Valin´
or¨
eo,
it might imply that this is a subject genitive – Valinor doing the hiding
instead of being its object. This would make little sense, since Valinor is not
a person who can “hide” anything. Conversely, oiencarm¨
e Eruo cannot
be understood as “perpetual production of the One” even if some kind of
sense could be made of this, for if Eru were the grammatical object that is
produced, we would evidently see oiencarm¨
e Eruva instead.
Probably, the o-case could be used for subject genitive and the va-case for
object genitive within the same phrase; if so it would probably be best to let
the former genitive precede the verbal noun. Nurtal¨
e Valin´
oreva or “Hid-
ing of Valinor” could then be expanded to Valaron nurtal¨
e Valin´
oreva,
“the Valar’s hiding of Valinor”. Or, to use a wholly home-made example:
Eruo melm¨
e Ataniva = “God’s love of Men”
and conversely:
Atanion melm¨
e Eruva = “Men’s love of God”
Summary of Lesson Twelve
The possessive (or adjectival) case is formed by adding the ending -va (prob-
ably -wa after nouns ending in a consonant), in the plural -iva. (There is
no explicit information about dual forms; presumably the ending -va can be
193


added to nouns with dual forms in -u, whereas the case ending might appear
as -wa when added to a dual form in -t.) If the ending -va is to be added
to a noun ending in two short syllables, and there is no ﬁnal consonant,
this ﬁnal vowel is lengthened before the case ending is added, so that it at-
tracts the stress: the possessive form of Orom¨
e is therefore Orom´
eva (not
**Oromeva). For some reason, such lengthening also occur if the diphthong
ui occurs in the second-to-last syllable of the noun; the possessive form of
huin¨
e “gloom” is therefore huin´
eva. – A possessive phrase like “X Yva”
(this is the only attested word order) may mean “Y’s X” or “Y of X” refer-
ring to simple ownership, e.g. lamb¨
e Eldaiva “the language of the Elves”
or coa i Eldava “the Elf’s house”. The pattern “X Yva” may also refer
to a permanent attribute (e.g. alcar Orom´
eva “the glory of Orom¨
e”), or
to the prevalent characteristic of a place (e.g. Taur¨
e Huin´
eva “Forest of
Gloom”). Another use of this case is expressing “X that consists of Y” (e.g.
yuldar lisse-miruv´
oreva “draughts of sweet mead”). – Verbal nouns, or
abstract nouns derived from verbs, denote an action viewed as a “thing”
or process. Such nouns may be derived in a variety of ways; relevant end-
ings include -m¨
e, -l¨
e, -i¨
e and -¨
e. Notice especially the ending -l¨
e, which (it
seems) may in principle be added to any A-stem verb, as when the verb
linda- “to sing” produces lindal¨
e “singing, music”. When dependent on a
verbal noun or an abstract clearly associated with some verb, the genitive
case takes on the meaning of a subject genitive (as in Altariello naini¨
e
“Galadriel’s lament”), whereas the possessive case is used for object genitive
(Nurtal¨
e Valin´
oreva “Hiding of Valinor”).

Lesson 13
The Dative case. The Gerund. Pronominal endings -lm¨
e and
-mm¨
e. An indeﬁnite pronoun.
13.1
The Dative case
Back in Lesson Five, we introduced the concept of grammatical objects, the
“target” of the verbal action performed by the subject: I Elda m´
ata massa
= “the Elf is eating bread”, i Nauco hirn¨
e harma = “the Dwarf found a
treasure”.
So far in this course, all the objects that we have concerned ourselves
with have been, more precisely, direct objects. These are objects directly
aﬀected by the verbal action. In archaic Quenya, such objects had their
own grammatical case, the accusative – but this case no longer had any
distinct forms in Third Age Quenya. But there are also indirect objects, to
which Quenya grammar likewise assigns special case forms. The case marking
indirect objects, the dative, was still alive and well in Third Age Quenya.
But before discussing how dative forms are constructed, let us have a closer
look on indirect objects.
An indirect object is, logically, an object indirectly aﬀected by the verbal
action of the sentence. Thus the indirect object is often the beneﬁciary of the
verbal action (though it may also denote a party that is adversely aﬀected
by this action). The archetypal example involves the verb “to give”, which
must logically entail three parties: the subject that does the giving, the
direct object which is the thing that is given, plus the indirect object that
is the recipient of the gift and thus the beneﬁciary of the verbal action:
The man [subject] gave the boy [indirect object] a book [direct object].
Modern English (unlike, say, German) has no distinct dative case, so in
the English example above, the noun “boy” receives no extra inﬂectional
elements to explicitly mark it as the indirect object of the sentence. In En-
glish, indirect objects may be indicated simply by word order; the indirect
object is then jammed into the sentence in front of the direct object, just
like “the boy” appears before “a book” in our example above. But just like
197


English often uses a phrase involving the preposition “of” instead of the gen-
itive case, the absence of a distinct dative case is frequently compensated
for by means of prepositional circumlocutions: The two prepositions most
often used to simulate the function of the dative case are “to” and “for”. So
instead of saying “the man gave the boy a book” (word order alone identi-
fying “the boy” as the indirect object), one might say “the man gave a book
to the boy”. Examples with “for” could be, say, “we did it for the children”,
or “the men work for the queen”.
In Quenya, “the boy”, “the children” and “the queen” of these examples
would be considered indirect objects – the parties indirectly aﬀected by the
verbal action – and the corresponding nouns would be inﬂected for the dative
case. There would be no need to maintain a speciﬁc word order, or to use
prepositions like “to” or “for”. Cf. the question occurring in the middle of
Nam´
ari¨
e, where the pronoun ni “I” (related to the pronominal ending -n or
-ny¨
e of similar meaning) appears in the dative case:
S´
ı man i yulma nin enquantuva? “Now who will reﬁll the cup for me?”
The element here translated “for” is not a separate word in Quenya; it is
simply the ﬁnal -n of nin – which -n is the Quenya dative ending. Hence
nin = “I-for”, or in correct English: “for me”. In other contexts it could
also have been translated “to me” or (where in English the indirect object is
identiﬁed by word order alone) simply “me”: The verb “to give” being anta-,
the Quenya equivalent of “you will give me a book” would in all likelihood go
something like antuvaly¨
e nin parma. The dative pronoun nin turns up in
the last line of F´
ıriel’s Song, as part of a sentence which Tolkien translated
“what will the Father . . . give me. . . ?” (LR:72). Of course, one might also
translate “. . . give to me”.
The Plotz Letter conﬁrms that the ending -n for dative is not only ap-
plicable to pronouns; it can also be attached to common nouns. (Plotz lists
ciryan as the dative form of cirya “ship” and points to lassen as the dative
form of lass¨
e “leaf”.) Thus we can build sentences like carnelyes i Naucon
“you did it for the Dwarf” or i n´
er antuva i parma Eldan “the man will
give the book to an Elf”. In English, the latter sentence could also be trans-
lated “the man will give an Elf the book”, word order alone indicating that
“an Elf” is to be understood as the indirect object of the English sentence.
In Quenya, word order would be much freer (the main advantage of a highly
inﬂected language!), the case ending indicating that the noun in question is
the indirect object no matter where the noun occurs in the sentence. This
enables the speaker to move the indirect object around to express subtle
nuances of emphasis. For instance, we may probably front the indirect ob-
ject to put special focus on it: Eldan i n´
er antuva i parma, meaning
something like “it is to an Elf [not to a Dwarf, etc.] the man will give the
book”. Whether the direct or the indirect object comes ﬁrst may not be very
198


material; while i n´
er antuva i parma Eldan means “the man will give
the book to an Elf”, i n´
er antuva Eldan i parma may be translated “the
man will give an Elf the book”.
In the plural, dative forms end in -in. Nouns with nominative plurals in
-i would in eﬀect simply add the dative ending -n; the Plotz Letter points
to lassin as the dative form of lassi “leaves”. The dative plural of a word
like laman (lamn-) “animal” would therefore be lamnin = “to animals”
or “for animals”. The ending -in is however also added to nouns that would
have nominative plurals in -r; the plural marker -r does not appear in da-
tive forms. From the ﬁrst line of F´
ıriel’s Song (translated “the Father made
the World for Elves”), we know what the plural dative of Elda would be:
Eldain. It should be noted that the ending -in merges with the last vowel
of the noun to form a diphthong, like ai in this case. F´
ıriel’s Song also pro-
vides the dative plural of “Mortals”: F´
ırimoin (nominative plural F´
ırimor,
LR:245; Tolkien later came to prefer the form F´
ırimar, as in the published
Silmarillion, chapter 12. The dative plural would then become F´
ırimain,
of course.)
In the previous lesson I pointed out that “it is not quite clear what would
happen when the [plural possessive-adjectival] ending -iva is added to a noun
already ending in -i, like t´
ari ‘queen’, or a noun with a stem-form in -i, like
l´
om¨
e (l´
omi-) ‘night’ (SD:415)”. The same problem arises in the case of the
plural dative forms. The dative singular “to/for a queen” would presumably
be t´
arin, but when trying to derive a plural dative by adding -in to t´
ari,
we are probably left with t´
arin once again (the ﬁnal -i or the noun and the
initial i- of the ending simply merging). Conceivably the two vowels might
merge into a long i, producing t´
ar´
ın as the word for “to/for queens”, but
this seems a somewhat unlikely word: Quenya rarely has a long vowel in a
ﬁnal unaccented syllable (though there is the word palant´
ır). It may well
be that t´
arin has to do duty for both singular and plural, so that one must
rely on the context to ﬁnd out which number is meant.
The dual dative ending is given as -nt in the Plotz Letter, the dual dative
form of cirya “ship” being listed as ciryant – which would mean something
like “for a couple of ships”. Of course, this ending -nt simply combines the
dative ending -n with the dual ending -t. Already in Lesson One I brieﬂy
mentioned that this -nt seems to be the sole example of a ﬁnal consonant
cluster being allowed in LotR-style Quenya. – It may be that only nouns
with nominative dual forms in -t would have dative dual forms in -nt; in
the case of nouns with dual forms in -u, it may well be that the simplest
dative ending -n would be employed. Once again using Aldu “Two Trees”
as our example, the dative form should perhaps not be Aldunt, but rather
Aldun (or possibly Alduen; see below concerning Ar-Veruen). We lack
examples either way, though.
In some instances, a sentence may include an indirect object (in Quenya,
a dative object) even though the sentence contains no direct object. In the
199


Quenya equivalent of “the men work for the king”, the English preposition
“for” would be represented by the case ending -n added to aran (probably
producing aranen, a helping vowel -e- intruding before the ending). There is
at least one attested example of a sentence having a dative object, but no di-
rect object: Tolkien in his Quenya version of the Pater Noster used a dative
form of the pronoun “we, us” when rendering the phrase “. . . those who tres-
pass against us”. (This, by the way, is an example of the dative case being
used to identify a party adversely aﬀected by the verbal action: The con-
text must decide whether the dative form should be translated “against us”
or “for us”. Grammatically speaking, both interpretations would be equally
valid, but “those who sin for us” would not make sense in this particular
context.) The verb “to trespass” or “to sin” can have no direct object, but
obviously some party may be indirectly aﬀected by the trespassing or sin-
ning, so there can be an indirect object – aptly presented as a dative object
in Quenya.
Dative forms may also turn up in sentences having no subject, a grammat-
ical phenomenon virtually unheard of in modern English. Yet such sentences
may be compared to phrases like “it seems to me that. . . ”, where the for-
mal subject “it” is actually nothing but a grammatical dummy with no real
content: In informal speech it may even be omitted, “seems to me that. . . ”,
and the meaning is quite intact. Such English wordings are comparable to
Quenya phrases like or¨
e nin caritas, literally “[it] impels for me to do it”,
expressing the meaning that in English might be worded something like “I
would like [or, feel moved] to do so” (VT41:13). Notice that the sentence or¨
e
nin caritas has no subject, but it does have a dative object: nin “to me, for
me”. Or- or ora- “impel, urge” is one of the Quenya impersonal verbs which
invite such constructions; we will return to these verbs in a later lesson.
An earlier application of the case ending -n: In Tolkien’s long evolution
of Quenya, -n was not always the dative ending. From the perspective of the
LotR scenario, one of the few things that are “wrong” with the Quenya of
the Etymologies (written in the mid-thirties) is that -n is here the genitive
ending instead. For instance, the entry lep lists the names of various Vali-
norean weekdays, including Ar Manwen = Day of Manw¨
e, or Ar Ulmon
= Day of Ulmo (cf. the noun ar(¨
e) “day” – though later Tolkien changed
the word for “day” to aur¨
e or r´
e, as indicated by the LotR appendices).
This use of the ending -n is also found in a phrase written in the mid-
forties, reproduced in SD:303: Quenta Eldalien, “History of the Elves
[Eldali¨
e, Elf-people]”. In draft versions of the poem that was to become
Nam´
ari¨
e, Tolkien used Vardan as the genitive “Varda’s” (see for instance
the early version reproduced in TI:284-285). In one of the later manuscripts,
Tolkien still wrote Vardan, but then he crossed it out and replaced it with
Vardo. This may seem to pinpoint the moment when Tolkien changed the
genitive ending from -n to -o. Actually the genitive ending -o turns up in
earlier sources as well; a “Qenya” poem of the early thirties already has
200


ciryo (spelt kiryo) as the genitive of cirya “ship” (langon veakiryo “the
throat of the sea-ship”, MC:216). As for the dative case, the “Qenya” of the
pre-LotR composition F´
ıriel’s Song already uses -n (pl. -in) as the dative
ending, as is evident from some examples quoted above. Later, -n for a while
reverted to being the genitive ending, as reﬂected by the Nam´
ari¨
e drafts. It
would seem that Tolkien changed his mind back and forth over the decades
– but the ﬁnal resolution, as reﬂected in LotR and as codiﬁed in the Plotz
Letter, was that -o is to be the genitive ending, while -n is the dative ending.
Some of the obsolete genitives from the Etymologies are still interesting
as forms. In the entry ay, the noun ailin “pool, lake” is said to have the
“g.sg.” (genitive singular) ailinen. Because of Tolkien’s later revisions, the
form ailinen must rather be understood as a dative singular in LotR-style
Quenya – meaning “for a lake” instead of genitive “of a lake”. The example
ailinen is interesting insofar as it shows us what happens if the case ending
-n (no matter what case it is assigned to!) is added to a noun ending in a
consonant, like ailin. Since **ailinn is not a possible Quenya word, an e is
inserted before the ending, producing ailinen. Though the ending -n had
its meaning redeﬁned, the principle of inserting this helping vowel whenever
it is required would still be valid.
If the noun has a special stem-form – the ﬁnal consonant turning into
another consonant or a consonant cluster when endings are to be added –
such changes occur before this extra -e- as well: In the entry lin2 in the
Etymologies, we learn that Laurelin (Laurelind-), the name of the Golden
Tree of Valinor, has the “g.sg.” Laurelinden. In LotR-style Quenya, this
would be the dative singular instead, but the form as such is presumably
valid still. The same goes for lissen as a form of lis (liss-) “honey”; see the
entry lis. We may then assume that a noun like n´
ıs (niss-) “woman” would
be treated in a similar fashion: dative nissen.
One of the “genitive” forms of the Etymologies may even throw some
light upon what the later dative of dual forms in -u should look like. One
Valinorean weekday listed in the entries bes and lep is Arveruen or Ar-
Veruen, the “Day of the Spouses”, referring to the Vala couple Aul¨
e and Ya-
vanna. Here we have veruen as the genitive of the dual form veru “spouses,
married pair”. It should be noticed that the helping vowel -e- is employed
here as well (somewhat surprisingly: one might have thought that **verun
would be an acceptable form). If this genitive veruen would still be a valid
form after Tolkien redeﬁned the ending -n so that veruen is a dative form
in LotR-style Quenya, it would indicate that nouns with nominative dual
forms in -u should have dative forms in -uen. The dative of Aldu “Two
Trees” would then be neither Aldunt nor Aldun, but rather Alduen. But
I hardly have to say that we are not on solid ground here, and I will not
construct any exercises based on such hypotheses.

13.2
The Gerund
Most of the time, nouns and verbs are distinct parts of speech. There are,
of course, the verbal nouns discussed in the previous lesson, but they are
unquestionably genuine nouns – abstract formations denoting verbal actions
considered as “things”. But verbs have one form, the gerund, which almost
deﬁes the dichotomy of noun vs. verb. One might say that a gerund is a verb
masquerading as a noun.
In Cirion’s Oath occurs the word enyalien, literally meaning “for recall-
ing” (that is, “in order to remember”). The preﬁx en- means “re-”, and the
ﬁnal -n is the case ending discussed above, the dative marker corresponding
to the English preposition “for”. Stripping away these extra elements, we
are left with -yalie-, yali¨
e. In his notes on Cirion’s Oath, as reproduced
in UT:317, Tolkien makes it clear that yali¨
e is an “inﬁnitive (or gerundial)
form” of a verb yal-, meaning to call or to summon. Thus we can isolate -i¨
e
as a grammatical ending used to derive ‘inﬁnitive or gerundial’ forms.
Earlier in this course, we have discussed another kind of inﬁnitive, which
is simply the stem of the verb (with -¨
e added, in the case of primary verbs).
An attested example is the sentence polin quet¨
e, “I can speak” (VT41:6),
with quet¨
e as the inﬁnitive form of the verb quet- “speak”. Since Tolkien
clearly identiﬁes -i¨
e as an inﬁnitive ending in UT:317, it may be that polin
queti¨
e would have be equally possible (more on this below). In her tutorial
Basic Quenya, written before the example polin quet¨
e became available,
Nancy Martsch uses -i¨
e as the Quenya inﬁnitival ending throughout. This
may not necessarily be wrong; Tolkien deﬁnitely imagined an old Elvish
inﬁnitive in -ie. In the Etymologies, entry nar2, the Old Noldorin word
trenarie “to recount” is explicitly called an “inf.” form (“Old Noldorin”
being the language Tolkien might later have referred to as Old Sindarin,
after he revised his linguistic mythos in the early ﬁfties). However, I think
that in many cases, the Quenya verb forms derived by means of the suﬃx
-i¨
e are best termed gerunds.
In English, gerunds are derived by means of the ending -ing, e.g. “ﬁnding”
vs. the verb “to ﬁnd”. Now a form like “ﬁnding” can of course also be
an abstract noun (synonymous with “discovery”) as well as an adjectival
participle (as in “the man ﬁnding the treasure”). But what we are interested
in here, is rather the word “ﬁnding” as it appears in a sentence like “ﬁnding
the treasure was wonderful”. Here, “ﬁnding” in a way behaves like a noun, for
it is the subject of the sentence. But we can tell that in some sense, “ﬁnding”
is still a verb, for it has not lost one of the unique characteristics of a verb:
the ability to take an object. In the phrase “ﬁnding the treasure”, “the
treasure” is the object of “ﬁnding”. If “ﬁnding” had here been an abstract
noun, one would have to use an “of”-construction to bring in the thing which
is found: “the ﬁnding (= discovery) of the treasure”. Cf. our discussion of the
Quenya object genitive (as in Nurtal¨
e Valin´
oreva, “Hiding of Valinor”)
202


in the previous lesson.
Since we are able to tell that in the sentence “ﬁnding the treasure was
wonderful”, the word “ﬁnding” is not a verbal noun, we can conclude that
it is actually a gerund. A gerund is a form of the verb which can function as
a noun, with much the same meaning as a genuine verbal noun. However, a
gerund is still capable of taking an object, and this goes for Quenya gerunds
as well: Regarding the Quenya gerundial form in -i¨
e which Tolkien used in
Cirion’s Oath, he noted that it was “governing a direct object” (UT:317).
NOTE: In Quenya as in English, gerunds and abstract nouns cannot always be clearly
distinguished. Just like the English ending -ing is used to derive both gerunds and verbal
nouns, the Quenya ending -i¨
e may also be used to derive abstracts, e.g. tyali¨
e “play” (as
noun) from the verb tyal- “to play”. Indeed -i¨
e is also used as a general abstract ending,
much like English “-ness”, cf. for instance morni¨
e “darkness”.
As usual, there is an extreme scarcity of attested examples. But we must
assume that in Quenya as in English, gerunds may often function as the
subjects of sentences, perhaps something like this:
Hiri¨
e harma caruva n´
er alya “ﬁnding a treasure will make a man rich”
Tiri¨
e i aiwi anta i vendin alta alass¨
e “watching the birds gives the
maidens [vendin, dative] great joy”
In these examples we have equipped the gerunds with objects (harma
and i aiwi), but a gerund could certainly function as subject without any
further additions, for instance like this: Mati¨
e n´
a i analta alass¨
e ily¨
e
tiuc¨
e Naucoron, “eating is the greatest joy of all fat Dwarves”.
Presumably Quenya gerunds can also function as the object of a sentence,
comparable to such English constructions as “I love ﬁshing”. The gerund
functioning as object may in turn govern its own object: A sentence like “I
love watching the birds” may perhaps be rendered into Quenya as melin
tiri¨
e i aiwi (“watching” being the object of the phrase “I love”, and “the
birds” in turn being the object of the gerund “watching”). Perhaps the latter
might also be expressed as “I love to watch the birds” = melin tir¨
e i aiwi
(?), using an inﬁnitive instead of a gerund. Gerunds and inﬁnitives may well
be interchangeable in many contexts, in Quenya as in English.
Indeed our terminology may be stricter than the one Tolkien himself used,
if we reserve the term inﬁnitive for forms like tir¨
e “to watch” and insist on
calling tiri¨
e “watching” a gerund only: In UT:317, quoted above, Tolkien
himself refers to the forms in -i¨
e as both “inﬁnitival” and “gerundial”. As we
mentioned above, in the “Old Noldorin” of the Etymologies one form in -ie
is explicitly identiﬁed as an inﬁnitive. The post-LotR example polin quet¨
e
“I can speak” demonstrates that -i¨
e at least cannot be a universal inﬁnitive
ending. Would polin queti¨
e be a possible wording, or would this sound
about as weird as “I can speaking” in English? And what about “I want to
ﬁnd a treasure”? Would merin hiri¨
e harma be OK, or would the Eldar
ﬁnd this wording as awkward as “I want ﬁnding a treasure” in English? It
203


may be safer to use the simplest inﬁnitive, hir¨
e, in such a context.
When a verbal action is the subject or object of a sentence, one may to
some extent choose between the inﬁnitives and gerunds in English: “To err
is human, to forgive is divine” = “Erring is human, forgiving is divine”.
Especially when a verbal action functions as subject, I think it would be
safer to use the gerund (the form in -i¨
e) in Quenya. But since we have no
actual examples, it is presently impossible to say with any conﬁdence what
Tolkien would have thought of as acceptable Quenya in this regard.
There is, however, one important use of the gerund which luckily is at-
tested in our tiny corpus. In English, the normal inﬁnitive (marked by “to”)
is often used to indicate purpose: “They have come to see the king.” Whether
this could be rendered “directly” into Quenya as ?ut´
ulient¨
e cen¨
e i aran
none can say at present – but I tend to doubt that this is a valid construc-
tion. Notice the wording used in Cirion’s Oath: Vanda sina termaruva
Elenna·n´
or¨
eo alcar enyalien. Tolkien’s translation in UT:305 goes “this
oath shall stand in memory of the glory of the Land of the Star”, but more
literally the Quenya wording is something like “this oath shall stand for
recalling [the] Elenna-land’s glory”. Cf. Tolkien’s comments on the form
enyalien in UT:317, already quoted in part:
yal- ‘summon’, in inﬁnitive (or gerundial) form en-yali¨
e, here in
dative ‘for the re-calling’, but governing a direct object [namely
alcar “glory”]: thus ‘to recall or “commemorate” the glory’.
So here we have a verb en-yal- “re-call-” = “commemorate”. Add the
gerundial ending -i¨
e, and we get the gerund enyali¨
e, “recalling”. Since a
gerund may be described as a verb functioning as a noun, it may also receive
case endings as a noun. So Tolkien supplied the dative ending -n “for” to
produce enyalien “for recalling”. The word can now function as the indirect
object of the sentence, the “benefactor” of the verbal action: The oath ter-
maruva “shall stand”, and this action promotes “recalling” (enyali¨
e). The
dative gerund enyalien “for recalling” in turn has Elenna·n´
or¨
eo alcar,
“[the] Elenna-land’s glory”, as its object.
Of course, in English one does not say “this oath shall stand for recalling
the Elenna-land’s glory”, but rather “this oath shall stand (in order) to recall
the glory of the land of Elenna”. Nonetheless, this example seems to tell us
that English inﬁnitives indicating purpose should be rendered into Quenya
as gerunds with a dative ending attached. “They have come (in order) to
see the king” would then translate into ut´
ulient¨
e cenien i aran, literally
“they have come for seeing the king”. (If we were to slavishly follow the
word order Tolkien used in Cirion’s Oath, with the gerund at the end of
the sentence, we would actually have to say ut´
ulient¨
e i aran cenien =
“they have come the king for seeing”! However, Quenya word order is in
all likelihood quite ﬂexible.) The rule we have tried to make out may be
204


summarized like this: If in English you can add the words “in order” in
front of a inﬁnitive without destroying the meaning (never mind the style!),
this inﬁnitive indicates purpose and should be rendered into Quenya as a
gerund inﬂected for dative.
Forming gerunds from A-stem verbs: All the gerunds so far exempliﬁed
have been formed from primary (ending-less) verbs. What happens if the
ending -i¨
e is to be added to an A-stem verb? We have no direct, explicit
attestations to guide us, so I saved this problem for the end. But all the
indirect evidence points to one conclusion: the ﬁnal -a should be dropped
before -i¨
e is suﬃxed.
The Etymologies, entry oro, lists the Quenya verb orta- “rise, raise”,
but a form ortie is also cited, though this is “Old Noldorin” (/Old Sindarin)
rather than Quenya. This word ortie, simply glossed “rise”, would be an
archaic Elvish form that later involved into a Sindarin inﬁnitive. But it
could very well correspond to a Quenya gerund orti¨
e “rising, raising”, since
“Old Noldorin” is relatively close to Quenya. This would indicate that when
the ending -i¨
e is to be added to an A-stem verb, the ﬁnal -a drops out
before the ending. We have one possible attestation of a Quenya form which
would conﬁrm this conclusion: Listing various forms of the verb ora- “urge”,
Tolkien did include ori¨
e (VT41:13), and while he did not clearly identify
this or any other of the forms, ori¨
e may well be intended as the gerund. Also
notice naini¨
e “lament(ing)” as a derivative of the verb naina- “to lament”
(compare RGEO:66 with the Etymologies, entry nay): Naini¨
e may be seen
either as a gerund or as a verbal noun.
As we have already touched on, -i¨
e can also function as a general ab-
stract ending, somewhat like English “-ness”. Where -i¨
e is used to form
abstract nouns from adjectives, adjectives in -a lose this ﬁnal vowel before
-i¨
e is added; morni¨
e “darkness” is apparently formed from morna “dark”.
Another attested pair of this kind is l´
ata “open” vs. l´
ati¨
e “openness”. The
abstract ending -i¨
e is certainly closely related to the gerundial ending -i¨
e;
basically it is the same ending we are dealing with (as noted above, the
distinction between gerunds and abstract nouns often becomes blurred). If
the ending -i¨
e causes a ﬁnal -a to drop out when it is added to adjectives, it
seems very likely that this also happens when it is added to A-stem verbs.
So starting from verbs like orta- “raise” and nurta- “hide”, we may proba-
bly derive the gerunds orti¨
e, nurti¨
e and build sentences like orti¨
e Pel´
ori
nurtien Valinor ´
um¨
e m´
ara noa “raising [the] Pel´
ori to hide Valinor was
not a good idea”. (It wasn’t – see MR:401, 405 for Tolkien’s critical com-
ments on this move by the Valar!)
In the case of verbs in -ya, e.g. harya- “to possess”, the entire ending -ya
would probably drop out before -i¨
e is suﬃxed. Otherwise the gerund would
have to be **haryi¨
e, but yi is not a possible Quenya combination. Abstract
nouns formed by means of the ending -i¨
e from adjectives in -ya are seen to
surrender the latter ending, e.g. veri¨
e “boldness” from verya “bold” (see
205


the Etymologies, entry ber). We may probably assume that veri¨
e would
also be the gerund of the related verb verya- “to dare”. So the gerund of a
verb like harya- “to possess” is most likely hari¨
e (e.g. in a platitude like
hari¨
e malta ´
uva car¨
e n´
er anwav¨
e alya, “possessing gold will not make
a man truly rich”).
13.3
The pronoun “we”
We have been practicing various pronominal endings: -n or -ny¨
e “I” (the
short form must not be confused with the dative ending!), -ly¨
e “you”, -s
“it”, -nt¨
e “they” and -t “them”. It is time to introduce the endings for the
ﬁrst person plural, corresponding to the English pronoun “we”.
There are actually several Quenya endings for “we”. One of them occurs
in the Cormallen Praise: Andav¨
e laituvalmet, “long shall we bless them”.
Here we have a future-tense verb with pronominal endings for “we” (subject)
and “them” (object): lait·uva·lme·t, “bless·shall·we·them”. The ending for
“we” is seen to be -lm¨
e (-lme-).
However, in WJ:371 Tolkien discusses the Quenya exclamation v´
a, signal-
ing refusal or prohibition: in eﬀect “no!” in the sense of “I will not” or “do
not!” Tolkien also indicated that this v´
a could receive explicit pronominal
endings, such as -n(y¨
e) for “I”, producing the form v´
an or v´
any¨
e for “I
won’t”. But Tolkien also mentioned the form vamm¨
e, “we won’t”. So here
the pronominal ending for “we” is suddenly not -lm¨
e, but rather -mm¨
e.
NOTE: Notice, by the way, how the long ´
a of v´
a is shortened in the form vamm¨
e.
This is one of the examples indicating that Quenya cannot have a long vowel in front of a
consonant cluster or a long consonant – a phonological rule we have repeatedly alluded to
earlier in this course. The fact that the vowel remains long in v´
any¨
e suggests that ny is
perceived as a single consonant, palatalized n like Spanish ˜
n, and not as a cluster n + y.
The fact that there are two endings for “we”, -mm¨
e and -lm¨
e, is easily
explained once we realize that this part of the Quenya pronoun table makes
a distinction not found in English. Tolkien referred to the ending -mm¨
e
as the “ﬁrst [person] plural exclusive” (WJ:371, emphasis added). The end-
ing -mm¨
e denotes an exclusive “we”, a “we” that excludes the person(s)
addressed. The exclamation vamm¨
e “we won’t” represents a refusal as it
would be spoken to some other party (likely the one whose will “we” refuse
to obey). This other party is not included in “we”, but stands outside the
“we” group. Therefore, the exclusive “we” is proper here.
On the other hand, the ending -lm¨
e apparently denotes an inclusive “we”:
The party being addressed is included in “we”. In the example andav¨
e
laituvalmet, “long shall we bless them”, the people who are praising Frodo
and Sam are addressing one another, not the Ring-bearers. If they had said
“long shall we bless you” instead, addressing Frodo and Sam directly, they
would have had to use an exclusive “we”: ending -mm¨
e instead of -lm¨
e.
206


Frodo and Sam would not be part of this exclusive “we”; they would stand
outside the “we” group addressing them. (Conversely, a group of people
conspiring among themselves about refusing an order would have to say
valm¨
e, not vamm¨
e, for “we won’t!”)
In written works, the word “we” would normally be exclusive (-mm¨
e),
unless the writer has reason to believe that the reader will be part of the
“we” group referred to. In such a case, -lm¨
e for inclusive “we” would be
proper.
Back in Lesson Eight, it was noted that while the author of this course may
sometimes seem to refer to himself as “we”, this is not (necessarily!) because
he has an ego of royal dimensions. The author tends to include the reader
in this “we”, as if implying that the author and the readers somehow share
this odyssey through the various aspects of Quenya grammar. (You can take
it as a friendly gesture, or as a particularly cunning brain-wash technique
which the author uses to somehow make you an accomplice whenever he
draws conclusions that he should actually take the full responsibility for
himself!) Anyhow, in Quenya there could have been no misunderstanding.
A royal “we”, excluding the people addressed, could only be -mm¨
e. An
author using the word “we” to refer to himself and his readers, directly
addressing them in his text, would have to use the inclusive “we”: -lm¨
e.
There is yet another ending for “we”, namely the dual inclusive, which is
“we” referring to two persons only – in eﬀect “you and I” or “the two of us”.
(The ending -lm¨
e would refer to an inclusive “we” involving three or more
persons.) Unfortunately, the ending denoting dual inclusive “we” must be
extrapolated in a two-step operation, and we cannot be quite certain about
its form (most likely either -lw¨
e or -lv¨
e). We will return to this problem
later; in the exercises below, we will only practice the endings -lm¨
e and
-mm¨
e.
NOTE: There has been much confusion regarding the Quenya endings for “we”. An
earlier interpretation, set forth in Jim Allan’s Introduction to Elvish in the late seventies,
had it that the ending -lm¨
e is exclusive rather than inclusive. The extrapolated ending
-lv¨
e was thought to be the inclusive “we” (and inclusive it would certainly have to be, but
it is a dual inclusive form, referring to a “we” of two persons only). The true ending for
exclusive “we”, -mm¨
e, was unknown until WJ was published in 1994 (providing the exam-
ple vamm¨
e). The wrong interpretation haunts many post-Tolkien Quenya texts written
before the mid-nineties, and it also made its way into Nancy Martsch’ Basic Quenya.
13.4
An indeﬁnite pronoun
In English, words like “one” and “you” are often used with deliberately
vague or general reference: “One has to earn a living. . . ” or “you have to
wonder. . . ” Here, “one” is not the number 1 (Quenya min¨
e), and “you”
does not refer to the one who is addressed. For such meanings, Quenya
207


has the pronoun quen (WJ:361) – essentially an unstressed variant of the
noun qu´
en, which simply means “person”. Though ultimately related to
Quend¨
e “Elf”, these words have no special reference to Elves. As usual, we
lack attested examples, but we must assume that quen would be used for
“one” or “someone” in such sentences as quen milyan¨
e leryal¨
e “one longed
for release” or quen hant¨
e i yulma “someone broke the cup”. Presumably
quen may also receive case endings, e.g. genitive queno “one’s” or dative
quenen (which in English would often be translated “for you” rather than
“for one”: Mati¨
e y´
av¨
e n´
a m´
ara quenen, “eating fruit is good for you” –
“you” here meaning “people in general”!)
Most Quenya pronouns usually appear as endings, and it may be that
Tolkien at one stage even reckoned with a pronominal ending for the indeﬁ-
nite pronoun “one”. There exists an early “Qenya” text where this meaning
seems to be associated with an ending -o: Kildo kirya ninqe, translated “a
white ship one saw” (MC:220–221). However, transforming this into LotR-
style Quenya would probably require rather more than altering the spelling
to cildo cirya ninqu¨
e: While the two last words would certainly be ac-
ceptable, the verb form kildo does not seem to ﬁt Tolkien’s later system,
and the status of the ending -o at the LotR stage is highly doubtful. If we
aim for LotR-style Quenya, it is certainly much safer to use the indeﬁnite
pronoun quen from a post-LotR source.
Summary of Lesson Thirteen
The Quenya dative case identiﬁes indirect objects, the party indirectly af-
fected by a verbal action (often the beneﬁciary of this action, though the
indirect object may also be adversely aﬀected by it). In the singular, the
dative ending is -n (when it is to be added to a noun ending in a consonant,
a helping vowel -e- is inserted before it). Nouns with nominative plurals in
-i have dative plurals in -in; this ending -in is also used in case of nouns
which have nominative plurals in -r, so that the dative form corresponding
to nominative Eldar is Eldain. The dual dative ending is -nt, at least in
the case of nouns which have nominative dual forms in -t. (Nouns with nom-
inative dual forms in -u should perhaps have dative dual forms in -uen, if
we can put any trust in earlier material where the ending -n was actually
assigned to the genitive case rather than the dative.) – A gerund is a form
of the verb which can function almost like a noun, denoting the correspond-
ing verbal action, but unlike regular verbal nouns, gerunds are still able to
take objects. Quenya gerunds are formed with the ending -i¨
e (also a general
abstract ending); if this suﬃx is to be added to an A-stem, the ﬁnal -a evi-
dently drops out. In the case of verbs in -ya, this entire ending is apparently
omitted before the suﬃx -i¨
e. English inﬁnitives expressing purpose (i.e., in-
ﬁnitives signifying “[in order] to do” something) translate into Quenya as
208


gerunds inﬂected for dative, e.g. hirien “(in order) to ﬁnd”. – Quenya has
several pronominal endings corresponding to English “we”. One of them is
-lm¨
e, denoting a “we” that includes the party that is addressed, whereas the
ending -mm¨
e expresses an exclusive “we”, used when the speaker addresses
a party outside the “we” group that the speaker himself belongs to. – The
indeﬁnite pronoun “one” or “someone” is in Quenya quen. Presumably it
can receive case endings, e.g. genitive queno “one’s”.
Vocabulary
In each Vocabulary section, we have ﬁrst of all introduced a new number.
The numbers 1-11 are explicitly mentioned in the Etymologies: min¨
e, atta,
neld¨
e, canta, lemp¨
e, enqu¨
e, otso, tolto, nert¨
e, cainen and minqu¨
e.
The Elvish way of counting, with base 12 instead of 10, would obviously
require a word for “twelve” as well – the last of the basic numbers. However,
the Etymologies does not mention the Quenya word for “twelve”, and neither
is it attested elsewhere. Etym only cites the primitive root-word for this
number: r´
asat. “No other forms are given,” Christopher Tolkien notes.
However, students of Elvish agree that a Quenya word derived from this root
would most likely have the form rasta (the complete Primitive Elvish word
being something like r´
asatˆ
a, the accent mark here indicating stress rather
than length). Some writers have used rasta in their own compositions, so it
is at least a post-Tolkien Quenya word. To complete our survey of the basic
numbers, I have included rasta in the vocabulary below – but it must be
understood that while this is deﬁnitely a plausible word, it is not explicitly
given in published material.
?rasta “twelve”
mahta- “to ﬁght”
anta- “to give”, irregular past tense ´
an¨
e. (This past tense is listed in a very
old source, the Qenya Lexicon p. 31. It is entirely possible that in Tolkien’s later
Quenya, the past tense of anta- could just as well be regular: antan¨
e. However, the
Sindarin verb form ´
onen “I gave” occurring in LotR Appendix A would correspond
to Quenya ´
anen rather than ?antanen. The Etymologies, entry ono, indicates that
the past tense of the verb onta- “beget, create” may be both ´
on¨
e and ontan¨
e;
perhaps the past tense of anta- may likewise be both ´
an¨
e and antan¨
e. We will
use the attested form ´
an¨
e here.)
suc- “to drink”
anna “gift”
alass¨
e “joy”
hroa “body” (related to a word introduced earlier, hr´
av¨
e “ﬂesh”; Tolkien meant them
to be descended from Primitive Elvish srawˆ
a and srˆ
awˆ
e, respectively. See MR:350.)
209

moral sense)
quen indeﬁnite pronoun “one”, “someone”
arwa adjective “possessing”, “in control of”, “having”, followed by genitive
(see note)
NOTE ON ARWA “POSSESSING, IN CONTROL OF”: This adjective is listed in
the Etymologies, entry 3AR (though it is derived from a variant root gar). It can be used
to form compound adjectives; Tolkien mentioned the example aldarwa “having trees” =
“tree-grown” (alda + arwa, “tree-having”). But apparently arwa “having, possessing”
can also be used by itself, and then it would be followed by a genitive form. (As we have
touched on above, the Quenya genitive ending was -n when Tolkien wrote the Etymologies,
but we must assume that the rule as such was still valid when he changed the ending to -o
later.) So we may probably have phrases like n´
er arwa collo, “a man having/possessing a
cloak” (colla “cloak”, genitive collo). Perhaps this may simply be translated “a man with
a cloak”, and if we use arwa to mean “with”, it would mean that the words for “with”
and “without” (arwa and ´
u, respectively) are both followed by genitive! Yet arwa is said
to be an adjective and not a preposition, so arwa presumably agrees in number, becoming
arw¨
e (for archaic arwai) when pointing back to a plural word: Neri arw¨
e collo, “men
possessing a cloak”, Naucor arw¨
e harmaron “Dwarves possessing treasures”, arani
arw¨
e ohtarion “kings in control of warriors”.

Lesson 14
The Allative and Ablative cases. Equ¨
e and auta: two
peculiar verbs. Possessive pronominal endings: -nya, -lya,
-lma, -mma.
14.1
The Allative and Ablative cases
The dative case ending -n presented in the previous lesson may sometimes
correspond to the English preposition “to”, as when it is appended to
gerunds: enyalien = “to recall” (UT:317). Yet this is a rather abstract
kind of “to”; as we have seen, the Quenya dative may also be translated as
phrases involving the preposition “for”, or it may simply correspond to a
speciﬁc English word order.
However, Quenya does have a special case form implying “to” in the more
basic sense of “towards” or “against”; the Latin term for such a case is alla-
tive. The relevant Quenya ending is -nna: In the entry Eldanna in the UT
Index, Christopher Tolkien identiﬁes this ending as a “suﬃx . . . of move-
ment towards”. The word Eldanna itself is not a bad example; it may be
translated “Elfwards” and was used by the N´
umenoreans as the name of
a bay on the west coast of N´
umenor, thus in the direction of the Blessed
Realm where the Eldar dwelt (UT:164). In Elendil’s Declaration, repeated
by Aragorn at his coronation, the ending -nna carries the full force of “to”
with the implication of motion towards: Et E¨
arello Endorenna ut´
ulien
= “out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth [Endor] I am come.” Cf. also the
sentence Sin Quent¨
e Quendingoldo Elendilenna (PM:401) – apparently
meaning “Thus Spoke Quendingoldo to Elendil” (or perhaps “This Quendin-
goldo Said to Elendil”; the meaning of the word sin is not quite clear). As
the allative forms of cirya “ship” and lass¨
e “leaf”, the Plotz Letter points
to ciryanna “to a ship” and lassenna “to a leaf”. (Of course, the stress
now falls on the vowel of the second-to-last syllable because of the following
consonant cluster introduced by the ending -nna: ciryAnna, lassEnna.) So
if you want to say “I’ll go to the ship” in Quenya, you don’t normally use
a separate word for “to”, but employ the ending -nna instead: Lelyuvan i
ciryanna.
212


While the ending -nna may sometimes be rendered “-wards” in English,
e.g. Elenna “Starwards” as a name of N´
umenor (see below), the English
ending “-wards” cannot be freely applied to any noun like the Quenya end-
ing can. But if the day ever comes when Columbus lend¨
e Americanna
can be translated “Columbus went Americawards”, people thinking this is
acceptable English, the language shall have acquired a living allative case.
NOTE: Besides -nna, there are also traces of an older allative ending in Quenya. In
primitive Elvish it had the form -da, later reduced to -d (WJ:366). In Quenya, this -d
became -z and later -r, and we have already met it in the word mir “into” (this is literally
mi-r “in-to”, cf. mi “in”!) Since this ending came to clash with the plural ending -r,
as in Eldar, it only survived in a handful of words indicating motion to or towards a
point. Attested examples include tar “thither”, oar “away”, yar “to whom” and mir
“into”. Actually “into” can also be minna with the normal, “modern” allative ending
-nna. Likewise, “thither” can be tanna as well as tar.
In the plural, the ending -nna changes to -nnar, hence lassennar “to
leaves” and ciryannar “to ships” (e.g. lelyuvan i ciryannar “I’ll go to
the ships”). The ﬁnal -r here appearing seems to be the same plural element
that we are familiar with from the nominative.
Since Quenya may express “to, towards” by means of a case ending, the
question naturally arises whether there is an ending for “from” as well. There
is.
As we pointed out in Lesson 11, the genitive ending -o may occasion-
ally take on this meaning, as in one word in Nam´
ari¨
e: Oioloss¨
eo = “from
Oioloss¨
e” (Mount Everwhite). However, the idea of “from” is more regularly
expressed by the ablative case, which is marked by the ending -llo. According
to Plotz, we can have forms like lassello “from a leaf” and ciryallo “from
a ship” (again accented on the second-to-last syllable, of course). So we may
build sentences like tulin i ciryallo “I come from the ship”. For a Tolkien-
made example, cf. the phrase m´
etima hrestallo “from the last shore” in
the Markirya poem. Both the ablative and the allative cases are exempliﬁed
in the phrase telmello talmanna “from hood [telm¨
e] to base [talma]”,
that is, “from top to bottom”. (In the entry tel of the Etymologies as re-
produced in LR, this expression is actually cited as “telmello telmanna”,
but this is plainly a typo, for as is evident from the entry tal, the word for
“base, foundation, root” is not telma, but talma.)
As for the plural form of the ablative, there are apparently several options.
Just like the suﬃx -nna for allative turns into -nnar in the plural, the
ablative ending -llo may have a plural equivalent -llor: In the Markirya
poem, Tolkien used elenillor as the plural ablative of elen “star”, hence
“from stars”. However, according to the Plotz letter, the plural ablative is
to have the ending in -llon instead. Here we have the same plural marker
-n as in the ending -on for plural genitive (the basic genitive ending -o +
the plural sign -n, WJ:407). One of Tolkien’s earlier tables of Quenya case
endings lists both -llor and -llon as possible plural ablative endings. So “I
213


come from the ships” could evidently be both tulin i ciryallor and tulin i
ciryallon. I generally prefer -llon, the Plotz variant, since the Plotz letter
is our best late source regarding the Quenya case system – but -llor must
be considered a valid alternative.
Dual allative/ablative: The dual forms of the allative and ablative end-
ings include the already-familiar dual element -t, which replaces one of the
consonants of the suﬃxes -nna and -llo to produce -nta and -lto instead.
Thus the nominative ciryat “two ships, a couple of ships” corresponds to an
allative form ciryanta “to(wards) a couple of ships” and an ablative form
ciryalto “from a couple of ships”. These are the examples Tolkien used in
the Plotz letter, but again it is uncertain whether the same endings would
be suﬃxed to a noun that forms its nominative dual in -u rather than -t.
Still using Aldu as our standard example, should “to the Two Trees” be
Aldunta or simply Aldunna? Similarly, should “from the Two Trees” be
Aldulto or simply Aldullo? I tend to think of Aldunna, Aldullo as the
likeliest forms, but lacking attested examples we cannot be sure.
Additional shades of meaning of the Allative and Ablative cases: While
the primary implication of these cases is “to(wards)” and “from”, they may
have other shades of meaning as well.
The idea of actual, physical motion towards or from something is not
always present. Notice the use of the ablative in a phrase found in J.R.R.
Tolkien – Artist and Illustrator: Itarild¨
e Ondolindello, “Itarild¨
e from On-
dolind¨
e”, or using the better-known Sindarin forms: Idril from Gondolin. In
English, this is best rendered Idril of Gondolin, identifying Idril as a person
living in Gondolin; the Quenya wording may not necessarily imply that Idril
had actually left Gondolin. Possibly, the ablative can also be used in other
ways that carry no implication of motion. It may be noted that regarding
the Quenya verb ruc- “to feel fear or horror”, Tolkien wrote that it is “con-
structed with ‘from’ of the object feared” (WJ:415). He did not provide any
further information or examples, but “from” is regularly expressed by the
ablative case in Quenya. So given that the Quenya word for “monster” is
ulundo, perhaps “I fear the monster” would translate something like rucin
i ulundollo. (Insofar as the words “from” and “of” express related mean-
ings, this may be compared to such an English wording as “I’m afraid of the
monster”.)
As for the allative, it does not always mean “to(wards)”, but may also
imply “on, upon”: The meanings are related insofar as an object that rests
“upon” something also presses “towards” it, though there is no actual mo-
tion. This use of the allative may typically occur in connection with the verb
caita- “lie”, as in this sentence from the prose Nam´
ari¨
e: Morni¨
e caita i
falmalinnar, “darkness lies on the foaming waves” (falma “foaming wave”,
here not only with the plural allative ending -nnar but also the “parti-
tive plural” marker -li, in this context possibly implying a great number of
waves: In his interlinear translation in RGEO:67, Tolkien analyzed falma-
214


li-nnar as “foaming waves-many-upon”). Further examples of allative forms
implying “on, upon” are found in the Markirya poem; we have atalanti¨
e
mindoninnar (or, mindonnar) “upon fallen towers” and axor ilcalannar
“on bones gleaming”.
However, the student should also notice that while the allative and ab-
lative cases may not always imply physical motion to or from something,
their basic meanings of “to, towards” and “from” may also be strengthened.
Instead of just indicating motion “towards” something, the allative may also
suggest motion “into” it: Attested examples include ¨
eari lantier cilyanna
“seas fell into a chasm” (LR:56) and mannar Valion “into the hands of
the Vali [Valar]” (F´
ıriel’s Song). The ablative may likewise indicate motion
“out of” something rather than merely “from” it: The word sindan´
oriello
occurring in Nam´
ari¨
e Tolkien translated “out of a grey country” (though in
the interlinear analysis in RGEO:67, he broke it down as sinda-n´
orie-llo,
“grey-country-from”).
These additional uses of the allative and ablative cases may lead to some
ambiguities: Is lenden i coanna to be interpreted “I went to the house” or
“I went into the house”? Where confusion may arise, it is probably best to
use the independent word mir (or minna) if “into” is the desired meaning:
Lenden mir/minna i coa. As for “out of” as opposed to merely “from”,
Elendil’s Declaration demonstrates that the word et “out” can be placed in
front of an ablative form to clarify the meaning: Et E¨
arello . . . ut´
ulien,
“out of [or, out from] the Great Sea I am come.” Some would even analyze et
“out” as a preposition governing the ablative case (like ´
u “without” governs
the genitive case).
Adding the allative and ablative endings to nouns ending in a conso-
nant: Suﬃxes like -nna and -llo and their dual/plural variants can never
be added directly to a noun ending in a consonant without creating im-
possible consonant clusters. For instance, the allative “to Elendil” cannot
be **Elendilnna, for Quenya phonology does not permit the group “lnn”.
As is evident from the actual form Elendilenna occurring in PM:401, the
language may work around this problem by inserting a connecting vowel e
before the case ending. The ablative and allative forms occurring in Elendil’s
Declaration in LotR may be examples of the same: et E¨
arello “out of the
Great Sea” (E¨
ar: Quenya name of the Ocean), Endorenna “to Middle-
earth” (Endor: Quenya for “Mid-land” = “Middle-earth”). However, the
word E¨
ar is also cited in the form E¨
ar¨
e (SD:305), and Endor is shortened
from an older form End´
or¨
e, so we cannot be absolutely certain that the
e’s occurring before the case endings in the forms E¨
arello, Endorenna
are not simply part of the nouns proper. On the other hand, the example
Elendilenna almost certainly includes a connecting vowel e, for there is
no reason to assume that the name Elendil ever ended in -¨
e. So the main
strategy for avoiding unwanted consonant clusters before case endings is
probably to insert an -e- before the ending.
215


It should be noted, though, that in the case of a plural noun requiring
a connecting vowel, it seems that -i- rather than -e- is preferred. We have
already mentioned that in the Markirya poem, Tolkien used elenillor as
the plural ablative form of elen “star”. If eﬀect, the pl. ablative ending
-llor has been added to the nominative plural eleni. One version of the
Markirya poem also had mindoninnar as the pl. allative “upon towers”
(before Tolkien decided to go for a contracted form instead; see below). Here,
the pl. allative ending has been added to the nominative plural mindoni
“towers”.
NOTE: Notice, though, that nouns in -¨
e with nominative plurals in -i (e.g. lass¨
e “leaf”,
pl. lassi) do not change their ﬁnal -¨
e to -i before -nnar or -llon/-llor is suﬃxed: Plotz
indicates that the pl. allative and ablative forms of lass¨
e are lassennar and lassellon,
respectively – not **lassinnar, **lassillon. In this respect, the allative and ablative cases
diﬀer from the genitive case: A noun that forms its nominative plural in -i always receives
this ending before the genitive plural ending -on is added – the genitive plural of lass¨
e
being lassion, not **lass¨
eon.
If one does not insert any connecting vowel, another way of getting rid of
an unwanted consonant cluster is to simply omit the ﬁnal consonant of the
noun that is to receive a case ending. Especially where the ﬁnal consonant
of the noun is identical to the ﬁrst consonant of the case ending, these two
consonants may simply merge. As indicated above, Tolkien ﬁrst used min-
doninnar as the plural allative of mindon “tower”. But then he decided
to drop the connecting vowel intruding before -nnar and introduced a con-
tracted form instead: Mindonnar, which simply represents mindon-nnar.
As we see, the ﬁnal -n of mindon merges with the ﬁrst n of the ending
-nnar. A more-well known example is Elenna (for Elen-nna) as a name of
N´
umenor: After following the Star of E¨
arendil across the ocean to their new
land, the Edain “called that land Elenna, which is Starwards” (Akallabˆ
eth;
cf. UT:317: Elenna·n´
or¨
e = “the land named Starwards”). In a similar fash-
ion, perhaps the ablative of Menel “heaven” could – or even should – be
Menello (for Menel-llo) rather than Menelello.
NOTE: We may wonder how certain nouns with special stem-forms would be treated.
In the case of talan, talam- “ﬂoor”, the allative “to a ﬂoor” or “(up)on a ﬂoor” might
probably be expressed as talamenna with a connecting vowel inserted (the ablative should
almost certainly be talamello), but perhaps we could also start from talan and use
talanna (for talan-nna) as the allative form? And what about a noun like toron, torn-
“brother”? Should “to a brother” be tornenna with a connecting vowel e inserted between
the stem-form and the case ending, or may we simply say toronna for toron-nna? At this
stage, we cannot know what Tolkien would have accepted as correct Quenya. I would not
reject any of these alternatives as wrong.
It seems that the ﬁnal -n of the four directions Formen, Hyarmen,
R´
omen, N´
umen “North, South, East, West” quite regularly drops out
before the case endings for allative, ablative and locative (the locative case
will be discussed in the next lesson). One haven in the east of N´
umenor was
216


called R´
omenna, literally “Eastwards” (see its entry in the UT index, and
cf. LR:47) – clearly because ships sailed eastwards from it. Of course, R´
omen-
nna > R´
omenna as such is just another example of a ﬁnal consonant of
a noun merging with the ﬁrst consonant of the case ending because they
happen to be identical. However, Nam´
ari¨
e provides R´
omello “from the
East” as the ablative of R´
omen “East”, and here there can be no doubt
that the ﬁnal -n has been omitted to avoid the impossible form **R´
omenllo.
It may be that R´
omenello with a connecting vowel inserted would also be
a valid form, but as I said, contracted forms seem to be normal when the
words for four basic directions are to be inﬂected for allative or ablative.
14.2
Equ¨
e and auta: two peculiar verbs
The verb equ¨
e: We have earlier introduced the Quenya word for “say” or
“speak”: quet- (aorist quet¨
e, present tense qu´
eta, past tense quent¨
e). Yet
this verb is not always used; there is an alternative word that may be used
to introduce quotations. In WJ:392, Tolkien refers to
. . . a curious and evidently archaic form that survives only in the
languages of Aman: [primitive] *ekwˆ
e, Q[uenya] eque, T[elerin]
epe. It has no tense forms . . . being mostly used before either a
proper name (sg. or pl.) or a full independent pronoun, in the
senses say / says or said. A quotation then follows, either direct,
or less usually indirect after a ‘that’-conjunction [e.g., “Galadriel
said that she wants to go to Middle-earth”]
So as far as inﬂection is concerned, this equ¨
e may well be the simplest verb
in the entire language. “It has no tense forms”, so equ¨
e may be interpreted
either as a past tense “said” or as present tense “say(s)”, depending on the
context (perhaps it could even cover the future tense “shall say”!) It is used
mainly where the subject is a full independent pronoun (to be discussed
later in this course) or a proper name (not a common noun). Also notice the
word order indicated by Tolkien: The word equ¨
e comes before its subject.
Tolkien gave us no actual sentences containing the word equ¨
e, but based on
the information he provided, something like the following must be possible:
Equ¨
e Elendil: “Et E¨
arello Endorenna ut´
ulien.”
Elendil says/said: “Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come.”
Tolkien glossed equ¨
e not only as “says”, but also as “say”. Since “say”
must be understood as a plural verb in English, it seems that unlike normal
verbs, equ¨
e does not receive the ending -r even where it has a plural subject
or more than one subject. Notice that Tolkien stated that equ¨
e is typically
“used before . . . a proper name (sg. or pl.)”. Now proper names normally
don’t appear in the plural (except in sentences like “there are many Johns
in this town”), so when Tolkien speaks of “pl.” proper names, he probably
217


means several proper names occurring together. So we must assume that a
sentence like this would be acceptable:
Equ¨
e Altariel ar Teleporno: “Ut´
uliemm¨
e Valinorello.”
Altariel and Teleporno [Galadriel and Celeborn] say/said: “We have come
from Valinor.”
Tolkien indicated that equ¨
e rarely received suﬃxes of any kind, usually
not even pronominal endings (WJ:392), though forms like equen “said I”
may also occur (WJ:415).
It cannot be wrong to replace equ¨
e with a form of the verb quet-, com-
plete with all the normal inﬂections (Elendil quet¨
e/quent¨
e. . . “Elendil
says/said. . . ”, Altariel ar Teleporno quetir/quenter. . . “Galadriel and
Celeborn say/said. . . ”) Where the subject is not a proper name or a full
independent pronoun, it would seem that a form of quet- is usually to be
preferred: I n´
ıs quent¨
e. . . “the woman said. . . ” Perhaps word order is also
signiﬁcant. Tolkien seems to be saying that equ¨
e is used to introduce a fol-
lowing quotation; if the speaker and the act of speaking is mentioned after
the quotation, it is perhaps better to use a form of quet-, e.g.
Equ¨
e Elendil: “Ut´
ulien.” = Elendil said: “I am come.”
but:
”Ut´
ulien,” Elendil quent¨
e = “I am come,” Elendil said.
Also where no direct or indirect quotation is included in the sentence at
all, it is probably best to use a form of quet-. Cf. the attested example
Sin Quent¨
e Quendingoldo Elendilenna referred to above (PM:401) –
apparently meaning “Thus Spoke Quendingoldo [= Pengolodh] to Elendil”.
Perhaps quent¨
e could have been replaced by equ¨
e here as well – but prob-
ably not.
The verb auta-: This verb means “pass” or “go away, leave (the point
of the speaker’s thought)” (WJ:366). Readers of the Silmarillion will have
encountered it in chapter 20, as part of a battle-cry: Auta i l´
om¨
e! “The
night is passing!”
According to the rules so far set out in the course, this verb is quite
irregular, though Tolkien may not have thought of it that way: In WJ:366
he refers to its various “regular forms”. Anyway, the past tense of auta- is
not **autan¨
e as we might expect. There are actually several possible past
tense forms. One of them is anw¨
e, formed by nasal-inﬁxion of the primitive
root-word awa; the ending -ta seen in auta- (primitive ?awatˆ
a-) does not
appear at all in this past tense form. However, the form anw¨
e was “only
found in archaic language”, so we will concentrate on the “modern” forms
instead.
There are two sets of past and perfect forms of the verb auta-, with
somewhat diﬀerent shades of meaning. If the meaning is “went away” in a
purely physical sense, about someone leaving one place and going to another,
218


the past tense form oant¨
e is used. According to Tolkien, this form is “regular
for a -ta verb of this class” (though most verbs in -ta seem to form their
past tense simply by adding the ending -n¨
e). The past tense is supposed
to descend from awantˆ
e, evidently a nasal-inﬁxed form of awatˆ
a, and in
Quenya, these words regularly developed into oant¨
e and auta, respectively.
(For the shift awa > oa, cf. one word introduced in the previous lesson:
hroa “body”, which Tolkien derived from primitive srawˆ
a.) – The perfect
tense of auta- used in the same “physical” sense is oanti¨
e = “has gone
away [to another place]”. This perfect form is obviously inﬂuenced by the
past tense oant¨
e. Tolkien noticed that the form oanti¨
e shows “intrusion of
n from the past [tense form]” (WJ:366): Normally, nasal-inﬁxion does not
occur in the perfect tense.
The other set of past and perfect forms of the verb auta- seems no less ir-
regular. The alternative past tense is v´
an¨
e, the perfect av´
ani¨
e. The ﬁrst syl-
lable of v´
an¨
e is apparently the Quenya descendant of the stem wˆ
a (WJ:366,
apparently another manifestation of awa), whereas the ending -n¨
e must be
simply the normal past tense ending. (Again, the perfect form seems inﬂu-
enced by the past tense form – the n of v´
an¨
e sneaking into the perfect
av´
ani¨
e.)
The form v´
an¨
e and the corresponding perfect av´
ani¨
e have acquired a
more “abstract” meaning than the forms oant¨
e, oanti¨
e. V´
an¨
e does not
mean “went away (to another place)”, but rather “disappeared”, “passed”.
The perfect av´
ani¨
e occurs (with the plural ending -r) in Nam´
ari¨
e, in the
sentence y´
eni ve lint¨
e yuldar av´
anier = “long years have passed like
swift draughts”. This sentence nicely illustrates the meaning of this perfect
form, for obviously the meaning is not that the y´
eni or “long years” have
gone away to another place (sc. oantier!) They “long years” have simply
passed, and now they are gone. Where the subject is more tangible than
“long years”, the forms v´
an¨
e/av´
ani¨
e would imply that the subject has
disappeared, is lost, has died oﬀetc.
Indeed Tolkien indicated that the meaning of v´
an¨
e/av´
ani¨
e was inﬂu-
enced by the related word vanwa “gone”, “lost”, “vanished”, “past and
over”. It occurs twice in Nam´
ari¨
e: S´
ı vanwa n´
a, R´
omello vanwa, Val-
imar = “now lost, lost [to those] from the East, is Valimar”. In WJ:366,
Tolkien calls vanwa the “past participle” of auta-, though it obviously has
no connection with the past or passive participles we have discussed earlier
in this course (constructed with the ending -na or -ina). There is some ev-
idence for an alternative, rarer participle in -nwa. However, for all intents
and purposes, it matters little whether we call vanwa a participle or merely
a verbal adjective (as does Nancy Martsch in her Basic Quenya).
NOTE 1: As pointed out in Lesson Eight, it may well be that when Tolkien wrote
Nam´
ari¨
e, he thought of the word av´
anier as the perfect form of a verb listed in the
Etymologies: vanya- “go, depart, disappear” (see the entry wan). We should still accept
Tolkien’s post-LotR ideas about the verb auta-; it occurs, after all, in such a primary
219


source as the Silmarillion. Interestingly, the adjectival word vanwa “gone, lost, over” is
found already in the Qenya Lexicon of 1915 (QL:99) and was retained throughout all
stages of Tolkien’s development of Quenya.
NOTE 2: In the Etymologies, entry gawa, a quite distinct verb auta- “to invent” is
listed. It would seem that the later verb auta- “go away” did not exist at the time Tolkien
wrote Etym. If we nonetheless accept both verbs as valid Quenya, we can distinguish
between them in some tenses, for auta- “to invent” may perhaps have the simplest past
tense: autan¨
e.
14.3
Possessive pronominal endings
So far, we have discussed ﬁve pronominal endings that may be suﬃxed to
verbs to function as their subject: -ny¨
e (often shortened to -n) “I”, -ly¨
e
“you”, -lm¨
e and -mm¨
e “we” (inclusive and exclusive), plus -nt¨
e “they”.
We have also pointed out that Quenya pronouns usually appear as endings,
not so often as separate words as in English.
Pronouns may also describe possession or belonging. Among the En-
glish possessive pronouns we have “my” (and “mine”), “your(s)”, “our(s)”,
“their(s)”. Quenya has endings for these pronouns as well, though these
endings are logically added to nouns, not to verbs. For instance, the end-
ing for “my” is -nya. Thus, “my house” is coanya, while “my land” would
be n´
orenya. The accent now falls on the syllable before the pronominal
ending: co-A-nya, n´
o-RE-nya. All the pronominal endings begin in a con-
sonant cluster, and in accordance with the normal rules, the stress falls on
the second-to-last syllable when its vowel is followed by a group of conso-
nants.
Notice that the subject endings that we have already introduced, all end
in the vowel -¨
e: -ny¨
e “I”, -ly¨
e “you” etc. The corresponding possessive
pronominal endings can be derived simply by changing the ﬁnal vowel to -a.
Here are the attested correspondences:
-ny¨
e “I” / -nya “my”
-ly¨
e “you” / -lya “your”
-lm¨
e “we” (incl.) / -lma “our” (incl.)
-mm¨
e “we” (excl.) / -mma “our” (excl.)
So besides coanya “my house” we can have coalya “your house”, whereas
coalma and coamma would both translate as “our house” in English.
NOTE: As for the distinction between inclusive and exclusive “our”, it would closely
correspond to the distinction between inclusive and exclusive “we”, explained in the pre-
vious lesson. Hence “our house” is expressed as coalma if the one(s) you are addressing is
(are) also among the owners of the house and thus included in the word “our”. Conversely,
coamma is the word to use for “our house” if you are talking to a party that is not among
the owners of the house and hence is not included in the word “our”.
220


It seems very reasonable to assume that the ending -nt¨
e “they” has a
counterpart -nta “their”, though the latter suﬃx is not attested in published
material. One problem may seem to be that it would clash with the dual
allative ending, but in context it would hardly be very diﬃcult to tell whether
(say) ciryanta is to be interpreted “to a couple of ships” or “their ship”.
Presumably the endings could even be combined: ciryantanta, “to their
couple of ships”! I won’t construct any exercises involving the unattested
ending -nta “their”, but I think it is safe enough to be recommended to
writers.
Combining pronominal possessive endings with endings for case and num-
ber: Combining these two kinds of endings is what truly makes the total
number of forms that a Quenya noun can assume explode. We are left with
hundreds of possible combinations, but since they are just that – combina-
tions – the endings involved are not nearly as numerous, and the load on
the student’s memory is not so great after all.
Here follows sambelya “your room” (samb¨
e “room, chamber” + -lya
“your”) inﬂected for the all the numbers and cases so far discussed in
this course. If this list appears somewhat complicated and daunting at ﬁrst
glance, the student will be relieved to discover that it is actually perfectly
regular and in a way contains no new information at all: Just start from
sambelya “your room” and treat it as you would any other noun in -a,
adding the normal endings for number and case. One consequence of this is
that the word now has a plural in -r (sambelyar “your rooms”), though
samb¨
e “room” occurring by itself would be an i-plural (sambi “rooms”).
• Nominative/Accusative: singular sambelya “your room”, dual
sambelyat “your couple of rooms”, plural sambelyar “your rooms”.
(In the archaic form of Quenya that had a distinct accusative, we would presum-
ably see the acc. sing. sambely´
a and the acc. pl. sambelyai, but in this course,
we don’t use distinct accusative forms.)
• Genitive: singular sambelyo “of your room” (the genitive ending -o
regularly displacing the ﬁnal -a of sambelya even though the -a is here
part of another ending), dual sambelyato “of your couple of rooms”,
plural sambelyaron “of your rooms”.
• Possessive: singular sambelyava “of your room”, dual ?sambelya-
twa “of your couple of rooms”, plural sambelyaiva “of your rooms”.
(While we here provide the same translations for the genitive and pos-
sessive cases, there are of course certain subtle shades of meaning that
distinguish them.)
• Dative: sambelyan “for your room”, dual sambelyant “for your
couple of rooms”, plural sambelyain “for your rooms”.
• Allative: sambelyanna “to your room”, dual sambelyanta “to
your couple of rooms”, plural sambelyannar “to your rooms”.
221


• Ablative: sambelyallo “from your room”, dual sambelyalto “from
your couple of rooms”, plural sambelyallon (or, -llor) “from your
rooms”. (In the case of the allative and the ablative, the accent falls on
the vowel in front of the case ending [e.g. sambelyAllo], in accordance
with the normal stress rules – which apply for all the forms here listed.)
NOTE: Elendil’s Declaration includes the words sinom¨
e maruvan, ar hildinyar “in
this place will I abide, and my heirs”. From the example hildinyar “my heirs”, one might
argue that plural nouns with plural forms in -i (like hildi “heirs”) should assume this
ending before pronominal endings and secondary plural markers (like the -nya- and -r
of hildinyar) are added. If so, “your rooms” should actually be sambilyar rather than
sambelyar as we suggested above. This is possible, but the example hildinyar may have
its own peculiarities; see below.
Notice that the possessive pronominal ending is added ﬁrst, and endings
for number and case are added after it: “From your room” is therefore sam-
belyallo, not **sambellolya. For a Tolkien-made example, cf. the greeting
Anar caluva tielyanna “the Sun shall shine upon your path” (UT:22, 51):
The noun ti¨
e “path” here appears combined with the pronominal ending -
lya “your”, and tielya “your path” is further expanded with the allative
ending -nna “upon” to express “upon your path”.
Another example of a noun equipped with both a pronominal ending and
a case ending occurs in the most famous Elvish greeting of all, “a star shines
on the hour of our meeting”: Elen s´
ıla l´
umenn’ omentielmo, as the ver-
sion printed in the ﬁrst edition of LotR went. With this lesson we have ﬁ-
nally presented all the grammar one needs to fully understand this sentence:
Elen “a star”, s´
ıla “shines” or rather “is shining” (the present/continuative
tense of the verb sil-), l´
umenn’ or in full l´
umenna “on (the) hour” (the
noun l´
um¨
e “hour” + the allative ending -nna “on”), and ﬁnally the word
that is relevant for our present discussion: omentielmo. This must be an-
alyzed as an abstract noun (or gerund?) omenti¨
e “meeting” + the ending
-lma for inclusive “our” (WJ:367), and omentielma “our meeting” is then
equipped with the genitive ending -o to express “of our meeting”: Hence
omentielmo, since the ending -o displaces a ﬁnal -a.
Dual inclusive “our”: In the revised edition of LotR (1966), Tolkien altered
the word omentielmo to omentielvo, though the translation remained the
same: “of our meeting”. Tolkien made up an “internal” explanation for this
change, brieﬂy referred to in one of Humphrey Carpenter’s notes on the
collection of Tolkien’s letters that he edited (Letters:447, notes on letter
#205):
The Elvish language Quenya makes a distinction in its dual in-
ﬂexion, which turns on the number of persons involved; failure
to understand this was, Tolkien remarked, ‘a mistake generally
made by mortals’. So in this case, Tolkien made a note that
222


the ‘Thain’s Book of Minas Tirith’, one of the supposed sources
of The Lord of the Rings, had the reading omentielvo, but that
Frodo’s original (lost) manuscript probably had omentielmo; and
that omentielvo is the correct form in the context.
The point seems to be this: In the greeting “a star shines on the hour
of our meeting”, the word “our” refers to a meeting of two people (Frodo
and Gildor, the former speaking to the latter). Therefore, a dual “our” is
appropriate here – “our” meaning “of you (sg.) and me”. Frodo’s “lost”
original manuscript instead had a plural “our” (ending -lma, or with the
genitive ending -lmo), but this is the kind of “our” that is used to refer
to something belonging to three or more people. It was inappropriate when
only 2 persons, Frodo and Gildor, were involved in “our meeting”. Frodo’s
little grammatical error was mercifully corrected in the “Thain’s Book of
Minas Tirith”, one of the copies of his original manuscript.
This “internal” explanation is of course mere rationalizing on Tolkien’s
part. From an “external” point of view, it is obvious what is going on:
After publishing LotR, the Professor couldn’t resist the temptation to con-
tinue tinkering with the Quenya pronoun table (a process that had already
been going on for decades). Tolkien apparently decided to introduce special
dual forms of (inclusive) “we” and “our”, used when only two persons are
involved: the speaker and the one who is addressed. Unfortunately, this re-
vision conﬂicted with a piece of already-published Quenya, but even so, the
Professor changed omentielmo to omentielvo and made up a little story
that would explain the discrepancy from an “internal” point of view: Frodo
just couldn’t get his grammar right! Gildor’s remark to the other Elves,
“here is a scholar in the Ancient Tongue”, suddenly ring rather ironic! Per-
haps we are to imagine mocking smiles twitching in their lips – “ah, after
all these centuries, mortals still can’t get their dual pronouns right. . . ”
So let us poor mortals try to ﬁgure it out: What, really, is the ending
for dual (inclusive) “our” – and the corresponding ending for dual inclusive
“we”? The most straightforward extrapolation would go like this: Removing
the genitive ending -o from omentielvo gives us omentielva, for surely this
pronominal possessive suﬃx ends in -a just like all the other attested endings
of this kind. We proceed to isolate -lva as the ending for dual inclusive “our”,
e.g. coalva “our house” of a house owned by two persons, one of them
speaking to the other. According to the pattern observed in such pairs as
-lya “your” vs. -ly¨
e “you”, we may further assume that our reconstructed
ending -lva “our” corresponds to an ending -lv¨
e “we” – a dual inclusive
“we” meaning “you (thou) and I”: Lelyuvalv¨
e i ostonna “we will go to
the city [, you and I]”. Notice that the ending for inclusive “we” introduced
in the previous lesson, namely -lm¨
e, would refer to a group of at least three
people.
NOTE: As far as is known, Quenya has no speciﬁc ending for dual exclusive “we” – sc.
223


an ending meaning “I and exactly one other person”! It is assumed that -mm¨
e is used
for exclusive “we”, and -mma for exclusive “our”, no matter whether two or more people
are involved. Cf. one of our home-made examples above; we put the words ut´
uliemm¨
e
Valinorello into the mouths of Galadriel and Celeborn. On the other hand, let none be
surprised if it turns out that Tolkien actually did invent speciﬁc endings for dual exclusive
“we” and “our”, to make the pronoun table wholly symmetric.
As I said, the most straightforward reconstruction based on the form
omentielvo “of our meeting” would lead us to extrapolate the inclusive
dual endings -lva “our” and -lv¨
e “we”. This reconstruction may well be
correct, and the student should notice these forms, for many writers have
used them. Yet there are other possibilities as well. If we are to isolate the
speciﬁcally dual element of the word omentielvo, it has to be the v, that
must somehow be related to the dual ending -u (as in Aldu “Two Trees”).
But if u were to be transmuted into a consonant, we would rather expect it
to become w, which is the corresponding “semi-vowel” – the vowel u used
as a de facto consonant. Therefore it has been suggested that the ending
for dual inclusive “our” may not be -lva after all, but perhaps rather -lwa.
According to this theory, adding the genitive ending -o produces -lvo in-
stead of **-lwo for the simple reason that wo (unlike wa) is not a possible
Quenya combination. Therefore, w (the consonant corresponding to u) here
becomes v before -o. A possible phonological parallel is provided by some of
the names quoted in PM:352–353. One example is Teluﬁnw¨
e “Last Finw¨
e”,
which is said to have a shorter form Telvo. This is apparently the initial
element of the full name, telu-, + the suﬃx -o (here functioning as a mascu-
line ending). Notice how the -u of telu- has become a v in the name Telvo,
evidently because of the following -o. Perhaps we are to imagine a develop-
ment whereby a form “Teluo” is reduced to two syllables by pronouncing
it “Telwo”, and this form in turn has to be altered to Telvo to get rid
of the unwanted combination wo. Similarly, “omentielwo” could plausibly
transmute into the attested form omentielvo.
If the ending for dual inclusive “our” is actually -lwa rather than -lva,
we may also assume that the ending for dual inclusive “we” is -lw¨
e rather
-lv¨
e. But extrapolating from a form that is itself reconstructed is of course
a risky business.
Adding pronominal endings to nouns ending in a consonant: To avoid im-
possible consonant clusters, an extra vowel -e- may be inserted before the
pronominal ending where necessary. As we remember, this extra vowel may
also turn up before case endings. Combining atar “father” with -lya “your”
to express “your father” would probably produce atarelya (since **atarlya
is not a possible Quenya word). “Our father” would be ataremma (exclusive
“our”) or atarelma (inclusive “our”) – and either atarelva or atarelwa if
“our” is a dual inclusive pronoun (“the father of the two of us”). It may be
that if the noun is plural, one would use i as the connecting vowel, if pronomi-
nal endings and case endings behave in the same way. Cf. Tolkien’s elenillor
224


for “from stars”. Thus, “your stars” might similarly be elenilyar, and “our
(excl.) fathers” should evidently be atarimmar rather than ataremmar.
(Of course, it is primarily the ﬁnal -r which functions as a plural marker
here, so there can be no misunderstanding regarding the number anyway.) It
may be that hildinyar “my heirs” from Elendil’s Declaration is an example
of this, if the noun “heir” is ?hil with a stem hild-, hence pl. hildi.
However, the ending -nya “my” seems to be somewhat special. Where a
connecting vowel is required, it apparently always prefers -i-, whether the
noun it is added to is singular or plural. It seems that this connecting vowel
reﬂects the vowel of the primitive root producing the Eldarin 1st person
pronouns, namely ni2 (listed in the Etymologies and simply deﬁned “I”).
F´
ıriel’s Song has Anarinya, not **Anarenya, for “my Sun”. Similarly,
“my father” is atarinya (LR:61) rather than ?atarenya; we cannot know
whether the latter form is valid at all. The (nominative) plural “my fathers”
would of course be atarinyar, so the singular and plural remain distinct. In
the same fashion, the singular form of hildinyar “my heirs” would perhaps
be hildinya “my heir” with the same connecting vowel i, since it is always
preferred by the ending -nya. In the case of another ending, like -mma
“our”, we might conceivably see a variation between hildemma (?) “our
heir” and hildimmar “our heirs”; in the latter case, the -i is the normal
nominative plural ending used as a connecting vowel. (The Etymologies,
entry khil, lists precisely such a plural form hildi – there glossed “followers”,
close enough to “heirs” in meaning.)
It has been suggested that the ending -nya, added to a noun in -¨
e, would
also displace this -¨
e with -i- (much like the plural ending -i displaces a ﬁnal -¨
e
when added to a noun). However, one Tolkien example that was published in
the summer of 2000 demonstrates that this is not so: VT41:11 has ´
orenya,
not **´
orinya, for “my heart” (´
or¨
e: “heart” in the sense of “inner mind”).
According to the system we are trying to sketch, even the plural “my hearts”
would be ´
orenyar rather than ?´
orinyar, since ´
or¨
e ends in -¨
e and thus
requires no connecting vowel before suﬃxes anyway. Cf. the Plotz Letter:
lassennar, not **lassinnar, as the plural allative of lass¨
e “leaf” – though
the nominative pl. is lassi. In a similar fashion, we would probably see
lassenya “my leaf” vs. lassenyar “my leaves” (hardly **lassinyar). The
connecting vowel -i- only turns up where plural nouns ending in a consonant
are to receive endings; singular nouns have -e- instead, except in the case
of the ending -nya “my” which prefers -i- whether the noun it is added to
is singular or plural. (If it is plural, this will be suﬃciently indicated by the
secondary endings for number and/or case that are added after the ending
-nya.)
NOTE: Of course, we must assume that nouns in -¨
e that have stem-forms in -i- would
appear in the latter form when endings are to be added. So if l´
ır¨
e (l´
ıri-) means “song”,
“my song” would evidently be l´
ırinya (plural l´
ırinyar “my songs”). But this is actually a
quite diﬀerent matter, for here we would evidently see l´
ıri- before any suﬃx, for pronoun
225


or case (l´
ırilya “your song”, ablative l´
ırillo “from a song”, etc.)
In some instances, contracted forms are used instead of inserting any con-
necting vowel. UT:193 provides the form aranya, untranslated but appar-
ently meaning “my king” (Erendis uses this word when addressing the King
of N´
umenor). This is apparently aran “king” + -nya “my”, the impossible
form **arannya being simpliﬁed to aranya. Possibly ?araninya would also
be acceptable Quenya, but when the noun ends in the same consonant as the
pronominal ending begins in, it may be permissible to let the last consonant
of the noun and the ﬁrst consonant of the ending merge – a phenomenon
also observed where case endings are involved. (Cf. mindonnar rather than
mindoninnar as the pl. allative of mindon “tower”; perhaps “my towers”
would be mindonyar rather than mindoninyar.)
Especially where the ending -nya “my” is concerned, contracted forms
may turn up even where no contraction would be “necessary” to achieve
a permissible Quenya word. The High-elven word for “son” is yondo, so
“my son” might simply be yondonya, and there is little reason to doubt
that this is a valid form. Yet in LR:61 Elendil addresses his son as yonya,
apparently a contracted variant of yondonya. Perhaps yonya would be
used for “my son” primarily when addressing the son concerned. If so, it
would parallel another example: One Quenya word for “child” is h´
ına, or
hina with a short vowel – the latter only being used when “addressing a
(young) child” (WJ:403). Tolkien went on to note that this hina, used as a
form of address, often appeared in the form hinya “my child” – the latter
being contracted from hinanya (still WJ:403).
Summary of Lesson Fourteen
The Quenya allative case has the ending -nna (plural -nnar) and expresses
the basic idea of “to, toward”, e.g. ciryanna “to a ship”. In certain con-
texts, this case may also express “on, upon” or “into”. The ablative case has
the ending -llo (plural -llon, alternatively -llor) and signiﬁes “from”, e.g.
ciryallo “from a ship”; sometimes the ablative may also imply “out of”. The
dual forms of the allative and ablative endings are -nta and -lto, respec-
tively (at least in the case of nouns with nominative dual forms in -t; it may
be that nouns with nominative dual forms in -u would rather have the basic
endings -nna or -llo following this vowel). If a noun ending in a consonant is
to receive the case ending for allative or ablative, a connecting vowel (in the
singular -e-, in the plural -i-) may be inserted before the case ending to avoid
an impossible consonant cluster; otherwise, a contracted form is used (e.g.
R´
omello “from the East”, for R´
omen-llo). – The verb equ¨
e is a peculiar
form that is not inﬂected for tense and rarely receives endings of any kind; it
means “said” or “says” and is used to introduce quotations where the sub-
ject (which follows the verb equ¨
e and precedes the quotation) is a proper
226


name or an independent pronoun. – The verb auta- “pass, go away, leave”
has rather surprising past and perfect forms: oant¨
e or oanti¨
e if the verb
refers to physically leaving one place (and going to another), but v´
an¨
e and
av´
ani¨
e if the verb refers to disappearing, being lost, or dying oﬀ. – Quenya
possessive pronouns are normally expressed as endings added to the rele-
vant noun (the thing that is owned). These suﬃxes include -nya “my”, -lya
“your”, -lma “our” (inclusive), and -mma “our” (exclusive). Notice that
these possessive endings correspond to the subject pronominal endings suf-
ﬁxed to verbs, the former ending in -a whereas the latter end in -¨
e (therefore
the unattested ending for “their” may well be -nta, corresponding to -nt¨
e
“they”). There is also a speciﬁc ending for dual inclusive “our”, but its form
cannot be conﬁdently reconstructed (either -lva or -lwa; only -lvo with the
genitive ending added is attested). Where required, connecting vowels may
be ﬁtted in before the noun and the pronominal ending, probably by much
the same rules that apply to the case endings -nna and -llo, except that
the ending -nya “my” seems to consistently prefer the connecting vowel -i-.
Once a noun has received a possessive pronominal ending, this noun may be
further inﬂected for number or case just like a regular noun in -a would be.
Vocabulary
We have now exhausted the basic numbers 1–12 (including the extrapolated
number rasta). Higher numbers are unfortunately rather uncertain, though
we have some clues. I may add some thoughts about this later, but in this
and the next couple of lessons we will introduce the attested ordinal numbers
– showing order or position in a series, like English “ﬁrst”, “second”, “third”
etc.
minya “ﬁrst” (cf. the number min¨
e “one” and the adjectival ending -ya. The original
name of the First Clan of the Elves was Minyar, literally “Firsts”, though the
Noldor later called them Vanyar or “Fair Ones” instead [WJ:380, 382–383].)
equ¨
e “say(s), said” (tense-less verb introducing quotations)
auta- “to leave, to go/pass away” (past tense oant¨
e and perfect oanti¨
e, alterna-
tively v´
an¨
e and av´
ani¨
e, the latter two forms referring to disappearing or dying
oﬀas explained above). The “past participle” of auta- is said to be vanwa “lost,
gone, passed, vanished” – but this word may be treated almost as an independent
adjective.
menta- “to send”
ruc- “to feel fear or horror”; “to fear” (said to be constructed with “from” of the
object feared, presumably meaning that what would be the direct object in English
appears in the ablative case in Quenya)
ambo “hill”
227


mindon “(great) tower” (cf. the Mindon Eldali´
eva or “Great Tower of the Eldali¨
e”
mentioned in the Silmarillion. The ﬁrst syllable of mindon is related to the number
min¨
e “one”, since a mindon is an isolated tower, not part of a larger structure.)
N´
umen “West” (cf. N´
umenor, N´
umen´
or¨
e “Westernesse” or “West-land”: n´
u-
me(n)-n´
or¨
e). It seems that the names of the basic directions are treated as proper
names, capitalized and not requiring the article; cf. R´
omello in Nam´
ari¨
e (which
Tolkien translated “from the East” even though there is no i in the Quenya text).
samb¨
e “room, chamber” (Sindarin sam, samm-; cf. the Sammath Naur or “Cham-
bers of Fire” inside Mount Doom)
yondo “son”
haira “far, remote”
et “out” (followed by ablative to express “out of”)
In addition to our traditional list of twelve new glosses we will also introduce a couple
of proper names, required in these exercises. In accordance with our established policy we
will avoid explicit references to Tolkien’s mythos in these exercises, so no proper names
coined by him will appear here. Yet we can readily coin new names using his principles.
The ending -(n)dil often occurs in masculine names and signiﬁes “friend” or “lover”,
e.g. E¨
arendil “Sea-friend” or Elendil “Star-friend” (but also implying “Elf-friend” since
the words elen and Elda are ultimately related and were even confused by the Edain:
WJ:410). So we can venture, say, Calandil “Friend of Light”. As for feminine names, one
observed pattern is that an adjective in -a can be turned into a fem. name by changing the
ending to -¨
e (not to be confused with the plural form of the adjective). For instance, one of
the queens of N´
umenor was called Ancalim¨
e, transparently formed from the superlative
form ancalima “brightest, exceedingly bright”. (Similarly, masculine names can be made
by changing the ending -a to -o or -on, cf. Sauron vs. the adjective saura “foul, putrid”
– one suddenly understands why the Dark Lord didn’t permit his servants to use the name
the Elves had given him!) Starting from a suitable adjective like nessima “youthful”, we
can derive a plausible woman’s name Nessim¨
e “Youthful One”. However, the meaning of
the names Calandil and Nessim¨
e is of no importance for the exercises.

Additional exercises
involving Quenya nouns combining pronominal endings with suﬃxes for
number and/or case
(Students may check the keys to the exercises above before proceeding to
these exercises.) There exercises above include several examples of nouns
with both pronominal endings and case endings, e.g. lielmava “of our peo-
ple”. A skilled Quenyaist would be able to extract the meaning of such forms
at a glance, indeed perceiving a single word like ostolmallon as something
229


like a single meaning, “from our cities”, without having to consciously break
this down into osto-lma-llo-n “city-our-from-plural”. Of course, a skilled
Quenyaist would also be able to readily produce such words, combining the
relevant endings without hesitation.
3. Translate the following list of single Quenya words into English phrases.
NOTE: In the keys to this exercise, the following simpliﬁed “equivalents” are used:
genitives and possessive-adjectival forms are all turned into “of”-constructions,
dative forms are represented as prepositional phrases in “for”, whereas allative
and ablative forms are represented as phrases involving the prepositions “to” and
“from”, respectively. The same system is used in the English-to-Quenya exercises
below, with speciﬁcation of whether “of” is to be rendered as a genitive (gen.) or
a possessive-adjectival (poss.) form. – In these exercises, there are also a few ex-
amples of the suﬃx for dual inclusive “our”, though conveniently always with the
genitive ending attached, since we know with certainty (from the attested example
omentielvo) what form it then assumes.
a) Coalmallon

Lesson 15
The ending -rya and more about possessive pronominal
endings. The Locative case. Relative sentences. Third Person
obscurities.
15.1
More about possessive pronominal endings
(plus a slightly digressive inquiry into the true nature of the
combinations ly, ny, ry, ty)
In the previous lesson we introduced a series of possessive pronominal end-
ings that can be added to nouns: -nya “my”, -lya “your”, -lma “our” (incl.)
and -mma “our” (excl.); furthermore, there is an ending for dual inclusive
“our”, either -lva or -lwa (only attested in the form -lvo with the geni-
tive ending -o added). Ignoring a strange variant of the ending -lya “your”
(-lda, to be discussed later), only one of the attested pronominal endings
remains to be mentioned: -rya. It occurs twice in Nam´
ari¨
e. The ﬁrst time it
is followed by the genitive ending, regularly producing the form -ryo: The
relevant word if ´
omaryo, translated “of her voice”, the genitive form of
´
omarya “her voice”. The word ´
oma “voice” is attested by itself elsewhere
(Etym., entry om; VT39:16).
The second time -rya occurs in Nam´
ari¨
e, it also has another ending fol-
lowing it, in this case the dual marker -t: the word m´
aryat is translated
“her hands”, referring to a natural pair of hands (the word m´
a “hand” is
also attested by itself). Anyhow, the ending -rya is seen to mean “her”, and
from the Namari¨
e examples it is clear that it can be used and combined
with other endings just like any of the other pronominal suﬃxes we have
already discussed and practiced (samberya “her room”, samberyan “for
her room”, samberyanna “to her room”, samberyallo “from her room”,
samberyo and samberyava “of her room”. . . and so on with plural and
dual forms: samberyar “her rooms”, samberyat “her couple of rooms/her
two-room apartment”, etc. etc.)
For thirty years, from The Fellowship of the Ring (with Nam´
ari¨
e in it)
appeared in 1954 until Christopher Tolkien published The War of the Jew-
232


els in 1994, “her” was the sole known meaning of the ending -rya. In the
meantime, we had one more example of -rya = “her” in the Markirya poem,
which was published in The Monsters and the Critics in 1983 (though in
Markirya, “her” does not refer to a person, but to a ship). But when WJ
appeared in 1994, it became evident that the suﬃx -rya actually covers not
only “her”, but also “his”: Coarya is shown to be the Quenya for “the
house of him” or “his house” (WJ:369, there spelt k¨
oarya). Of course, the
form coarya as such could just as well mean “her house”, and conversely
the Nam´
ari¨
e forms m´
aryat, ´
omaryo could in another context mean “his
hands” and “of his voice”: We have to conclude that Quenya simply does
not make a distinction between “his” and “her”. Indeed it is entirely possible
that -rya covers “its” as well (see below) – so that there is one single ending
for the entire third person singular in the table of possessive pronouns. The
English translation would depend on the context, of course.
There is more to learn from the two examples of -rya in Nam´
ari¨
e. Notice
the dual form m´
aryat “her (pair of) hands”. As described in Lesson Three,
Quenya developed a system whereby -t is the normal dual ending, ordinarily
replaced by -u only where euphonic concerns demand this, as when the
word that is to receive a dual ending already includes t or d (Letters:427,
footnote). But in Lesson Three we also argued from the example peu “(pair
of) lips” that body-parts occurring in pairs occur in “fossilized” dual forms,
always taking the ending -u – “reﬂecting the older system in which only
-u denoted a natural or logical pair”. Nonetheless, the student may also
remember a parenthetical warning to the eﬀect that “the other ending -t
may however be used if certain other endings intrude before the dual ending
itself; we will return to this in a later lesson”. It is time to have a closer look
on this.
It has often been assumed that removing the ending -rya “her” from
m´
aryat “her hands” would simply leave us with m´
at “(a pair of) hands”.
Yet since the dual form of p´
e “lip” is attested as peu, we might reasonably
assume that the dual form of m´
a “hand” is likewise mau “pair of hands”,
though the latter form remains unattested. If the noun that normally has a
dual form in -u is to receive a possessive pronominal suﬃx, it seems that the
dual ending -u is suppressed and duality is instead expressed by means of the
ending -t, suﬃxed after the pronominal suﬃx – as in m´
aryat. Though the
dual “(pair of) lips” is peu, we can assume that “her (two) lips” would be
constructed by starting from the singular form p´
e “lip” and adding -rya for
“his/her” and then -t for dual number, so that as a parallel to m´
aryat we
would see p´
eryat. (It then follows that the genitive is p´
eryato, the dative
p´
eryant, the allative p´
eryanta, the ablative p´
eryalto, etc.) Aldu may be
the normal dual “pair of trees”, but “her pair of trees” would perhaps be
constructed from the singular alda with the appropriate suﬃxes, producing
aldaryat. Even so, we may suspect that the dual ending -u could function
as a connecting vowel where one is needed – just as the plural ending -i
233


is known to function in certain instances. The word for “foot” is t´
al with
stem tal-, so perhaps the dual “(pair of) feet” is talu. Adding a possessive
pronominal ending to t´
al, tal- would however require a connecting vowel
before we can even think about adding -t as a dual marker at the end of
the word. Should “her pair of feet” perhaps be something like taluryat
with double dual markers, -u- and -t, just like there would apparently be
double plural markers (-i- and -r) in a plural word like (say) talimmar “our
feet”? If so, this would be an exception to the apparent rule that the dual
marker -u is not used before a possessive pronominal suﬃx. As usual, we
lack attested examples, but since Elendil’s Declaration indicates that “my
heirs” is hildinyar, it would not be wildly implausible to assume that a
corresponding dual form would be something very much like hildunyat.
(Or maybe the rule that -nya “my” prefers -i- as its connecting vowel would
prevail, producing hildinyat, but we might still see -u- as a connecting
vowel before other pronominal endings, e.g. hilduryat “her pair of heirs”.)
Another thing to be learnt from the Nam´
ari¨
e examples m´
aryat “her
hands” and ´
omaryo “of her voice” has to do with whether ry here counts
as a consonant cluster (r + y) or as a single consonant: palatalized r. What
we learn is however somewhat paradoxical. We touched on these problems
already in Lesson One, but a new inquiry may be in place here, since the
combinations in -y (like ry, ly, ny, ty) occur in several of the possessive
pronominal endings. Tolkien repeatedly indicated that ´
omaryo is accented
on the a in the second-to-last syllable (in one of his Nam´
ari¨
e transcripts
in RGEO, he indicated all major and minor stresses in this song, and we
also have two actual recordings where he is heard to use this accentuation).
For ´
omaryo to be accented in such a way, ry must count as a consonant
cluster, not as a single consonant. If ry were a single consonant, the normal
rules dictate that the stress would not land on the vowel before it, but on
the third syllable from the end.
Yet we have repeatedly referred to another observed rule of Quenya pho-
nology: there cannot be a long vowel in front of a consonant cluster. Thus
the long vowel of m´
a “hand” is logically shortened in the plural allative form
mannar “into . . . hands”, attested in F´
ıriel’s Song. **M´
annar would not
be a possible Quenya word. So if ry is also a consonant cluster as we thought
we had just established, why is ´
a not shortened in the form m´
aryat? Why
don’t we see ?maryat as a parallel to mannar?
Frankly, I can’t think of any obvious explanation. Apparently we must
simply accept that ry – as well as ly, ny, ty – count as consonant clus-
ters for the purpose of stress, but a preceding long vowel does not have
to be shortened. Thus we would have m´
arya “his/her hand”, m´
anya “my
hand” and m´
alya “your hand” with the preceding long vowel intact. Be-
fore the other attested pronominal suﬃxes, it would have to be shortened,
since these endings unquestionably introduce a following consonant cluster:
malma and mamma = “our hand” (inclusive and exclusive). **M´
alma,
234


**m´
amma would hardly be possible Quenya words. Such variations would
closely parallel a couple of attested forms we have referred to earlier, though
they involve subject endings (-mm¨
e for “we” and -ny¨
e for “I”) rather than
the pronominal possessive endings added to nouns: The exclamation v´
a
signifying refusal has its long vowel shortened before the cluster mm in
vamm¨
e “we won’t”, but the long vowel is seem to persist in v´
any¨
e “I
won’t” (WJ:371). So we can tell that while mm is unquestionably a cluster,
ny may well count as a single consonant – palatalized n like Spanish ˜
n.
There are only a handful of nouns that can be aﬀected by these variations
in vowel-length, words of a single syllable that end in a long vowel: Besides
m´
a “hand”, only c´
u “bow”, p´
e “lip”, r´
e “day” (24 hours) and l´
u “time,
occasion” spring to mind – if we don’t bring in Tolkien’s early “Qenya”
material as well. Of course, the long vowels of these words would also be
shortened before case endings introducing a following consonant cluster,
as indicated by the plural allative mannar “into hands” in F´
ıriel’s Song.
But “into your hands” would evidently be m´
alyannar, or m´
alyanta as a
dual form – since ly, ny, ry, ty do not count as consonant clusters for this
purpose.
On the other hand, there is also some evidence suggesting that these com-
binations should be taken as clusters. In a Nam´
ari¨
e manuscript reproduced
in RGEO:76, Tolkien split the word ´
omaryo into its constituent syllables
and seemingly indicated that -ar- and -yo are separate syllables – as if ry
is a genuine consonant cluster after all, not just palatalized r. (Sure enough,
r would probably be palatalized before y, but if y is also to be sounded as
a distinct consonant, we would still have a cluster.) Likewise, Tolkien split
the words fanyar “clouds” and ily¨
e “all” into fan/yar, il/y¨
e. If ry, ny,
and ly, and by implication ty as well, really are to be taken as consonant
clusters when they occur in the middle of words, that would explain the
observed stress patterns. But then we are left with the problem of why long
vowels are not shortened before these combinations. Luckily, these seeming
inconsistencies cause no problems to people trying to write in Quenya, since
we can simply imitate the system or systems that Tolkien used.
Even so, I haven’t bored the student with the paragraphs above only as
an academic exercise, for there remains the problem of how ly, ny, ry, ty
occurring in the middle of words should really be pronounced: Are we dealing
with single, unitary palatalized consonants, long palatalized consonants, or
single consonants followed by a distinct y? It seems that we can’t reach
any deﬁnite answer based on what has been published so far. When Tolkien
in RGEO:76 syllabiﬁed fanyar as fan/yar, it seems to demonstrate that
he at least can’t have the pronunciation **fa˜
n-ar in mind, though palatals
like ny and ty must always be pronounced as single, unitary consonants
when they occur initially (as Quenya cannot have consonant clusters at the
beginning of words: SD:416–417). The choice apparently stands between
fa˜
n-˜
nar (with a long or double palatal ˜
n) and fan-yar or rather fa˜
n-yar (a
235


distinct y being sounded). In either case, a word like atarinya “my father”
(that is, atari˜
n˜
na or atari˜
nya) would then logically be accented on the i
according to the normal rules. Why this combination ny, as well as ly, ry,
ty, apparently lack the power to make a preceding long vowel become short
remains a mystery. If they are pronounced with a distinct y, as I tend to
think, these combinations may not be counted as regular consonant clusters
because y is a “semi-vowel” rather than a quite “proper” consonant.
Possessive pronominal endings used with inﬁnitives: In Lesson Ten we
described how inﬁnitive forms of verbs have an extended form in -ta which
is used when the inﬁnitive is to receive a suﬃx denoting an object pronoun:
thus car¨
e (cari-) “to do”, but caritas “to do it” or “doing it”. To such an
extended inﬁnitive it is also possible to add a pronominal ending denoting
the subject of the verbal action. Our attested example is caritalya(s), which
Tolkien translated “your doing (it)” (VT41:17). “You” is here the subject of
the verbal action (that is, the “doing”), and this is expressed as a possessive
pronominal ending -lya “your”. A second pronominal ending, denoting the
object, may then be added at the end of the word: caritalyas, “your doing
it”, tiritanyat “my watching them”. Such a phrase can probably be used
as a noun, functioning, for instance, as the subject or object of a sentence.
Perhaps “I want you to watch them” would be expressed something like
merin tiritalyat, literally “I want your watching them”. The object of
the inﬁnitive could certainly be an independent word as well, e.g. merin
tiritalya i seldor, “I want you to watch the boys” (“I want your watching
the boys”).
By their meaning, such inﬁnitives would come very close to gerunds. In-
deed we must assume that regular gerunds (in -i¨
e) may also receive posses-
sive pronominal endings, e.g. tulierya “his coming” (tuli¨
e “coming”). It is,
however, uncertain whether a second pronominal ending denoting the object
may then be suﬃxed (?carieryas “his doing it”).
15.2
The Locative case
In connection with the forms mir, minna “into” we have referred to the
Quenya preposition mi “in”, which is sometimes combined with the deﬁnite
article to produce the form (mi + i =) m´
ı “in the”. It occurs in Nam´
ari¨
e,
in the phrase m´
ı oromardi, translated “in the high halls” (so in RGEO:66,
at least – the text in LotR has mi with a short vowel, though this should
be a simple “in” with no article incorporated, and indeed the translation
provided in LotR goes simply “in lofty halls”).
Yet Quenya often dispenses with prepositions, using special case forms
instead, as when “to, towards” is normally expressed by the allative ending
-nna, whereas “from” is usually expressed by means of the ablative ending
-llo – though Quenya does have separate prepositions that could express
236


the same meanings. It should be no surprise, then, that Quenya instead of
using a preposition like mi often prefers a speciﬁc case form in order to
express the meaning of “in” (or “on, upon”). The relevant case is called
the locative, marked by the ending -ss¨
e (probably inspired by the Finnish
ending -ssa, -ss¨
a of similar meaning). For instance, “in a house” can be ex-
pressed as coass¨
e, “in the house” could be i coass¨
e, “in my house” would
be coanyass¨
e, etc. (Of course, the stress moves to the vowel immediately
preceding the case ending, since the ending begins in a consonant cluster.)
The locative can refer to “location” in time as well as space: In an early ver-
sion of the greeting “a star shines on the hour of our meeting”, Tolkien had
the noun l´
um¨
e “hour” appearing in the locative case (l´
umess¨
e, RS:324).
NOTE 1: Students should notice that the ending -ss¨
e is not always a locative marker,
meaning “in” or “on” wherever it occurs. Sometimes -ss¨
e functions as an abstract ending.
We have already introduced the noun alass¨
e “joy, merriment”. Entuless¨
e is attested as
the name of a ship, said to mean “Return” (UT:171; entul- would be the verb “to re-come”
= “to return”). Caimass¨
e could be the locative form of caima “bed”, but caimass¨
e is
also used as a noun “lying in bed” = “sickness”, and this is even the basis of the adjective
caimass¨
ea “bedridden, sick” (Etym., entry kay). Sometimes -ss¨
e as a noun ending is not
abstract, but it is seen to maintain the connotations of locality that it also has when used
as a locative ending: The noun aicass¨
e “mountain peak” is derived from the adjective
aica “sharp”, so the term aicass¨
e basically refers to some kind of ‘sharp place’. The
ending -ss¨
e also turns up in the names of a couple of the months of the Elvish calendar,
listed in LotR Appendix D: V´
ıress¨
e and L´
otess¨
e, roughly corresponding to April and
May. The meaning of the word V´
ıress¨
e is uncertain, but L´
otess¨
e certainly connects with
l´
ot¨
e “ﬂower” and would seem to mean essentially “In Flower”, a ﬁtting description of the
month of May. – Whether the locative ending -ss¨
e could or should be attached to a noun
already ending in -ss¨
e is uncertain. L´
otessess¨
e does seem like a rather cumbersome way
of expressing “in May”, and aicassess¨
e for “on a mountain peak” is not much better.
Instead of adding the locative ending to nouns of such a shape, it may be better to use
the preposition mi “in”: Mi L´
otess¨
e, mi aicass¨
e.
NOTE 2: As we remember, the allative case in -nna does not always denote motion
towards something, but may also express the idea of “on, upon”. In some contexts, it would
perhaps be permissible to use either the locative or the allative, resulting in pretty much
the same meaning (caitan caimanyass¨
e = “I lie in my bed” / caitan caimanyanna
“I lie on my bed”). Yet Tolkien sometimes translated a Quenya locative form using the
English preposition “upon”. Cf. for instance ciryass¨
e “upon a ship” (MC:216, there spelt
kiryasse); cf. also mahalmassen below.
In the plural, the simple locative suﬃx -ss¨
e is expanded with the same
plural element -n that is also seen in the plural forms of the endings for
genitive (-on) and ablative (-llon). Thus, plural locative forms end in -ssen.
The plural locative of mahalma “throne” occurs in Cirion’s Oath, where
the Valar are referred to as i h´
arar mahalmassen mi N´
umen, “those
who sit upon [the] thrones in the West”.
The dual locative ending is formed by substituting the dual element t
237


for the ﬁrst of the s’s of the ending -ss¨
e. The resulting ending -ts¨
e is not
attested in any actual Quenya composition by Tolkien, but he listed it in the
Plotz letter, so presumably we can have forms like sambets¨
e “in a two-room
apartment” or ciryanyats¨
e “on my [two sister] ships”. (These words may
be seen as the simplest dual forms sambet, ciryanyat with the locative
ending -ss¨
e attached, though it is simpliﬁed to -s¨
e to avoid the impossible
combination **-tss¨
e.)
Of course, endings like -ss¨
e, -ssen, -ts¨
e can never be added directly to a
noun ending in a consonant without producing impossible consonant clus-
ters. Lacking attested examples, we can only assume that connecting vowels
would be ﬁtted in by much the same rules as the ones that are seen to ap-
ply in the allative and ablative cases: -e- is used as a connecting vowel in
the singular, whereas plural forms have -i-. Hence presumably eleness¨
e “in
a star”, elenissen “in stars”. The dual “in a couple of stars” might pre-
fer the connecting vowel -e- (?elenets¨
e). Contracted forms may also turn
up, e.g. eless¨
e for elen-ss¨
e. The directions Formen, Hyarmen, N´
umen,
R´
omen = North, South, West, East would almost certainly surrender their
ﬁnal -n in the locative, just as they are seen to do in the allative and abla-
tive cases. Hence probably Formess¨
e “in the North”, etc. F´
ıriel’s Song has
N´
umessier for “they are in the west”. This strange form seems to include
the ending -i¨
e “is”, pl. -ier “(they) are” which Tolkien probably dropped
later. Even so, an underlying locative form N´
umess¨
e “in the West” must in
any case be presupposed here. Since the noun N´
umen “West” also appears
in the shorter form N´
um¨
e, we cannot be certain that a ﬁnal -n has dropped
out here, but this locative form may be noted all the same.
Would nouns with dual forms in -u also form their dual locatives in -
ts¨
e, or does this ending occur only where we are dealing with nouns that
have nominative dual forms in -t? We may well wonder what the locative
form of Aldu “Two Trees” would be. Alduss¨
e with the simplest ending -
ss¨
e, because duality is already suﬃciently expressed by -u? Aldats¨
e formed
from the uninﬂected form alda? Alduts¨
e with double dual markers, -u and
-t-? Personally I lean toward Alduss¨
e, but I would like to see a Tolkien-
made example.
The locative ending(s) can of course be combined with possessive pronom-
inal endings just like the other case endings we have discussed. The Markirya
poem has ringa s´
umaryass¨
e for “in her cold bosom” (ringa “cold”, s´
uma
“bosom”; the reference is to the “bosom” of a ship).
15.3
Relative sentences
In LotR, there is one single example of a Quenya locative. The ending -ssen
for plural locative occurs in Nam´
ari¨
e, in the phrase Vardo tellumar. . . ,
yassen tintilar i eleni = “Varda’s domes. . . , wherein [or, in which] the
238


stars twinkle. . . ”
The word ya “which”, here appearing with the locative ending -ssen to
imply “in which”, is a relative pronoun. It can be used to build relative sen-
tences, that is, sentences embedded in other sentences as a kind of descriptive
phrases. Two sentences like “the treasure is great” and “you found it” can
be combined as “the treasure which you found is great”. Notice that the
pronoun “it” of the sentence “you found it” is replaced by “which”. This
relative pronoun is capable of referring back to the words “the treasure”,
and “which I found” now becomes a descriptive phrase providing extra in-
formation about “the treasure”. The probable Quenya equivalents of these
examples:
I harma n´
a alta “the treasure is great”
+ hirnelyes “you found it”
= i harma ya hirnely¨
e n´
a alta “the treasure which you found is great”
As a relative pronoun, English may also use “that” (“the treasure that
you found. . . ”)
In German, the deﬁnite articles der, das, die (all = English “the”, for var-
ious genders and numbers) are also used as relative pronouns. The Quenya
article i may likewise take on this function. This is evident from Cirion’s
Oath, the last words of which exemplify i used ﬁrst as article, then as rel-
ative pronoun: . . . i Eru i or ily¨
e mahalmar ¨
ea tennoio, “the One who
is above all thrones forever”. Since “the One” (Eru, God) is a person and
not a thing, the relative pronoun must here be translated “who” rather than
“which”. If there is any distinction in meaning between i and ya used as
relative pronouns, this may indeed be it: i refers back to a person (English
“who”), while ya refers back to a thing or a situation (English “which”).
Notice, by the way, that these glosses have nothing to do with the question-
words “who” and “which”: The word i cannot be used for “who” in a ques-
tion, like “who are you?” The Quenya word for “who” in this sense is quite
diﬀerent (man).
NOTE: This “who/which” distinction is not the only possible interpretation of our
scarce examples. By another suggestion, i is used when the relative pronoun is the subject
of the relative sentence, while ya is used when it is the object: Elda i tir¨
e Nauco “an
Elf who watches a Dwarf”, but Elda ya tir¨
e Nauco “an Elf whom a Dwarf watches”
(English uses “whom” as the object form of the relative pronoun “who”). We need more
examples before we can pick the right interpretation with conﬁdence.
The word i is in Quenya the “indeclinable article ‘the’” (Etymologies,
entry i). That is, i = “the” cannot be declined; it cannot receive any case
endings. We must assume that this is still true when i functions as a relative
pronoun “who” instead. However, ya is perfectly able to receive case endings,
as indicated by the example yassen “in which” from Nam´
ari¨
e. The locative
ending is plural because the relative pronoun refers back to a plural word,
239


tellumar “domes”; in the case of a single telluma or “dome”, the relative
pronoun referring back to it would likewise be singular: yass¨
e. Likewise with
other nouns: coa yass¨
e “a house in which. . . ”, but plural coar yassen. . .
“houses in which. . . ”
Besides the form yassen in Nam´
ari¨
e, we have one more example of ya
occurring with a case ending. An early Elvish poem by Tolkien includes
the words tanya wende . . . yar i vilya anta miqilis, translated “that
maiden . . . to whom the air gives kisses” (MC:215, 216). This is not quite
LotR-style Quenya, so I don’t regularize the spelling, but the form yar “to
whom” is interesting. The ﬁnal -r here suﬃxed to ya seems to be the old
allative ending, as in mir “into”; hence yar = “whom-to”, “to whom”. The
examples yassen “in which” and yar “to whom” suggest that if you need a
relative pronoun to receive case endings, such endings are always attached
to ya-. Even if ya means “which” and i means “who” as we theorized above,
a form like yassen may well cover both “in which” and “in whom” (since we
can’t have a distinct form **issen for the latter meaning if i is indeclinable).
We must assume that ya can receive all the various endings for number and
case, being inﬂected like a noun in -a, as in these examples:
• Dative: i n´
er yan ´
anen annanya “the man to whom I gave my
gift”, plural i neri yain. . . “the men towhom. . . ” (The attested form
yar “to whom”, occurring in a context involving the verb “give”, may
evidently also take on dative-like functions – but yar is properly an
archaic allative, and generally I think yan, pl. yain, is to be preferred.)
• Genitive: i n´
ıs yo yondo cennen “the woman whose [= who’s] son I
saw” (we must assume that ya + the genitive ending -o would produce
yo, a ﬁnal -a being displaced as usual), plural i nissi yaron. . . “the
women whose [= who’s]. . . ” (for a form like yaron, cf. aldaron as
the plural genitive of alda “tree”)
• Possessive: i aran yava malta mapuvan “the king whose [= who’s]
gold I will seize”, plural i arani yaiva. . . “the kings whose [= who’s]. . . ”
• Allative: i coa yanna lenden “the house to which I went / the
house whither I went / the house that I went to”, plural i coar
yannar. . . “the houses to which. . . ”
• Ablative: i coa yallo tullen “the house from which I came / the
house whence I came / the house that I came from”, plural i coar
yallon [alternatively, yallor]. . . “the houses from which. . . ”
• Locative: i coa yass¨
e marin “the house in which I live / the house
that I live in / the house where I live”, plural i coar yassen. . . “the
houses in which. . . ”
In the nominative singular, the simple form ya is of course used: i parma
ya et´
ecien, “the book which I have written”. It may be that this would
240


become yar (with the plural ending -r) when referring back to a plural
word: i parmar yar. . . “the books which. . . ” (Distinguish the attested
relative pronoun yar “to whom”, MC:215, 216; this form includes the old
allative ending -r instead.) Where i is used as a relative pronoun, it receives
no plural ending, since i is indeclinable: Eldar i lindar “Elves who sing”.
We have listed no dual forms, but they would presumably be quite reg-
ular: nominative yat (e.g. i peu yat. . . “the [pair of] lips that. . . ”), da-
tive yant (e.g. i veru yant. . . “the [married] couple to/for whom. . . ”),
genitive yato, possessive yatwa (?), allative yanta, ablative yalto, loca-
tive yats¨
e (e.g. i sambet yanta/yalto/yats¨
e. . . “the two-room apartment
to/from/in which. . . ”)
It should be noted that in some grammatical contexts, a case ending that
could have been added to ya may be omitted and understood. For instance,
given that the word for “night” is l´
om¨
e (l´
omi-), we could presumably have
a sentence like l´
omiss¨
e yass¨
e cennenyes “in [the] night in which I saw
it” = “(in/on) the night when I saw it”, but it is also permissible to let ya
occur by itself: L´
omiss¨
e ya cennenyes, a construction paralleling English
“in [the] night that I saw it” (very frequently, English would drop the initial
“in”, but in Quenya the locative ending should probably be included).
Notice that the article may be dropped before the ﬁrst noun (l´
omiss¨
e in
our example); it is perhaps suﬃciently determined by the following relative
phrase. Tolkien employed such a construction in his Quenya translation of
the Hail Mary (he paraphrased “in the hour of our death” as “in [the] hour
that we shall die”).
Usually, a relative pronoun refers back to a noun so that the following
relative sentence provides information about that noun, as in all the exam-
ples above. Notice, however, the example i carir quettar “those who form
words”, quoted as a description of the Elves (WJ:391). I carir quettar by
itself is a relative sentence, and we could certainly connect it with a noun
and let the relative sentence refer back to it, e.g. Eldar i carir quettar
“Elves who form words”. However, it appears that i can be put in front of a
verb to express “the one who” (if the verb is singular) or “those who”, “the
ones who” (if the verb is plural, marked by the ending -r). Cirion’s Oath pro-
vides another example: i h´
arar mahalmassen mi N´
umen “those who sit
upon thrones in the West”. We can probably feel free to build sentences like
these:
I lind¨
ea n´
a n´
ıs “[the one] who is singing is a woman”
I hirner i malta nar aly¨
e “[the ones] who found the gold are rich”
Hiruvan i suncer limpenya “I will ﬁnd [the ones] who drank my wine”
(singular . . . i sunc¨
e limpenya, “[the one] who drank my wine”)
If ya can also be used in such constructions, and we are right to assume
that i signiﬁes “who” while ya means “which”, there may be distinctions
in meaning like ec´
enien i t´
ula “I have seen [the one] who is coming” vs.
241


ec´
enien ya t´
ula “I have seen what is coming” (literally, “I have seen [that]
which is coming”). The sentence “what I want is wine” would perhaps trans-
late something like ya merin n´
a limp¨
e (i.e., “[that] which I want is wine”).
Word order: Some languages employ a special word order in relative sen-
tences. German insists on placing the verb last, so that we have constructions
like “the man who there stands” (der Mann der dort steht) for “the man
who stands there”. For a while I wondered if Quenya employed a similar sys-
tem; the verb ¨
ea “is, exists” appears near the end of the relative sentence
concluding Cirion’s Oath: i or ily¨
e mahalmar ¨
ea tennoio, literally “who
over all thrones is forever”. However, as we see, the verb is not absolutely
ﬁnal; an entirely “German” word order would require “who over all thrones
forever is”.
In Nam´
ari¨
e, the verb actually follows immediately after the relative pro-
noun in the relative sentence yassen tintilar i eleni “wherein the stars
twinkle”, literally “in which twinkle the stars”. We might think that this
is just a “poetic” word order, but Tolkien did not change it in the prose
Nam´
ari¨
e in RGEO:66–67. Does it make any diﬀerence that this is a relative
pronoun with a case ending attached? Would it be wrong to say yassen i
eleni tintilar, with the subject of the verb preceding rather than follow-
ing the verb? We cannot tell. Especially in the case of yasse(n), yanna(r),
yallo(n) “in/to/from which”, I would imitate our attested example and let
the verb immediately follow the relative pronoun: I osto yass¨
e mar¨
e i
n´
er “the city in which the man dwells”, i tol yanna c´
ırar i ciryar “the
island whither the ships are sailing”, i n´
ori yallon tulir i ohtari “the
lands whence the warriors come”. Otherwise, I will not try to make out any
hard-and-fast rules for what word order Quenya relative sentences should
have.
15.4
Third Person obscurities
Above we introduced the possessive pronominal ending -rya, covering “his”
and “her”. So what is the corresponding subject ending, meaning “he” and
“she”?
Since the ending -lya “your” is known to correspond to an ending -ly¨
e
“you”, many researchers, starting from -rya “her”, have extrapolated an
unattested suﬃx -ry¨
e as the subject ending = “she”. If, as indicated by
Nam´
ari¨
e, the Quenya for “you will ﬁnd” is hiruvaly¨
e, “she will ﬁnd” would
then be hiruvary¨
e. Nancy Martsch uses this extrapolated ending -ry¨
e “she”
throughout her Basic Quenya – and it may well be correct. Now that it is
known that -rya covers “his” as well as “her”, we would have to assume
that -ry¨
e may similarly signify “he” as well as “she”.
The subject endings of the Third Person Singular – the endings for “he”,
“she”, and “it” – however belong to one of the more obscure parts of the
242


Quenya pronoun table. In material closely related to F´
ıriel’s Song, one end-
ing for “he” is seen to be -ro. It occurs in the form antav´
aro “he will give”,
attested in the question e man antav´
aro? “what will he give indeed?”
(LR:63). Ant´
ava as the simple future tense “will give” occurs on the same
page (and in the full text of F´
ıriel’s Song as printed in LR:72). This may
not be quite LotR-style Quenya; as we argued in Lesson Seven, the future
tense of anta- should perhaps be antuva rather than ant´
ava according to
the system Tolkien decided upon later. Even so, the form antav´
aro nicely
illustrates one apparent property of the ending -ro: For some reason, the
vowel immediately preceding this ending is lengthened, ant´
ava becoming
antav´
aro when -ro is added (and the original long vowel of ant´
ava is
shortened to avoid the form **ant´
av´
aro: It may be that Quenya cannot
have a long vowel in the syllable immediately preceding the vowel receiving
the main accent except when this syllable is also the ﬁrst syllable of the
word). Should we update antav´
aro to something like antuv´
aro in LotR-
style Quenya?
This ending -ro also turns up in a “Qenya” poem reproduced in MC:220,
there added to a couple of verb forms including the past-tense ending -n¨
e,
and again the vowel preceding -ro is lengthened so that it receives the accent.
One of them is laustan´
ero, which would seem to be a verb lausta- “make
a windy noise” (cf. MC:216) + the past tense ending -n¨
e + the ending -
ro “he” (and “it”?) The whole phrase goes s´
uru laustan´
ero, translated
“the wind rushed” (literally perhaps “[the] wind, he/it [-ro] rushed”). Since
this is “Qenya” rather than LotR-style Quenya, we shouldn’t put too much
emphasis on the details, but Tolkien does seem to be using an ending -
ro, that may mean “he” (but also “it”?), and that has the strange power of
making the preceding vowel long. It has been suggested that the vowel rather
remains long in this position because Tolkien imagined it to have been long
in Primitive Elvish. If so, the vowel -i- seen in the aorist of primary verbs
(e.g. tulin “I come”) should not be lengthened, since this vowel was never
long (?tuliro rather than ?tul´
ıro for “he comes”).
Where would this ending -ro for “he” come from, and what is the ending
for “she”? The entry s- in the Etymologies throws some light on what Tolkien
imagined. Various Elvish words for “he, she, it” are there discussed. One
primitive word for “he” is cited as sˆ
o or so, “cf. -so inﬂection of verbs” –
apparently meaning that the primitive Elvish language might express “he”
by means of an ending -so added to verbs. This -so could be the origin of
the Quenya ending -ro, for in Quenya, -s- occurring between vowels was
normally voiced to -z-, which later became -r- (the sound z merging with
original r). In the Etymologies, Tolkien went on to cite one primitive word
for “she” as sˆ
ı or si, “cf. -se inﬂexion of verbs”. If -so produces -ro as a
Quenya ending for “he”, we would have to assume that -se similarly yields
-r¨
e (earlier -z¨
e) as an ending for “she”. This -r¨
e is possibly directly attested
in the “Qenya” phrase kirya kalli´
ere, translated “the ship shone” (MC:220,
243


221) – literally “[the] ship, she shone”? Turning the form kalli´
ere into LotR-
style Quenya would probably take more than just altering the spelling to
calli´
er¨
e, but it may be noted that the ending -r¨
e, like -ro, seems to prefer
the company of a long vowel in the preceding syllable.
Many writers have used the endings -ro = “he” and -r¨
e = “she”, so
students of Quenya should certainly memorize them – but as far or short as
we know, they are only attested in material predating the writing of LotR.
In 1994, there ﬁnally turned up a tiny scrap of evidence regarding Tolkien’s
post-LotR ideas about the pronominal ending for “he, she”. In the essay
Quendi and Eldar, in the discussion of the tense-less verb equ¨
e “said, says”,
Tolkien noted that while this form normally does not receive endings of any
kind, it may occur with certain pronominal endings. He cited two examples
of this: equen, translated “said I”, and also eques, translated “said he /
she” (WJ:414) or “said he, said someone” (WJ:392). So here we have an
ending -s that covers both “he” and “she” (or even “someone”). In the post-
LotR period, Tolkien demonstrably used the ending -rya for both “his” and
“her”, so it is not surprising that he might have decided that Quenya used
one ending for both “he” and “she” as well (cf. also the Finnish gender-
neutral pronoun h¨
an.) Actually this ending -s must also cover “it”, for it
can hardly be kept apart from the ending -s that we have already met in
object position – as in tiruvantes “they will keep it” (Cirion’s Oath) or
caritalyas “your doing it” (VT41:17). So eques could probably mean “it
said” just as well as “(s)he said”. Conversely, -s may probably refer to people
in object position as well: Perhaps tiruvantes might also mean “they will
keep [or, watch] him/her”.
A form like tulis would have to be translated either “he comes”, “she
comes”, or “it comes” depending on the context. The existence of such an
ending does not necessarily contradict the references Tolkien made to primi-
tive “-so inﬂexion” and “-se inﬂexion” of verbs in the Etymologies: Normally,
the ﬁnal short -o and -e of primitive Elvish have been lost in Quenya, so
primitive forms like tuli-so “he comes” and tuli-se “she comes” might well
merge as tulis “(s)he comes”. Where this would leave the longer, gender-
speciﬁc endings -ro and -r¨
e found in early material is unclear. Tolkien may
have meant them to descend from variant endings with long vowels (-sˆ
o and
-sˆ
e), ﬁnal -ˆ
o and -ˆ
e becoming -o and -¨
e in Quenya. Perhaps the gender-
speciﬁc endings would be used where the short, general 3rd person ending
-s “he, she, it” is not speciﬁc enough? But there is every reason to believe
that Tolkien repeatedly changed his mind about the details; we can’t even
rule out the possibility that the long endings -ro “he” and -r¨
e “she” were
dropped altogether.
Anyhow, if -s is to be the ending for “(s)he”, where does this leave the
unattested ending -ry¨
e that some students have (plausibly) extrapolated
from the possessive ending -rya “his, her”? The ending -ry¨
e may still be
valid. Perhaps the ending for “(s)he” alternates between -s and -ry¨
e just
244


like the ending for “I” may appear as either -n or -ny¨
e. (While the endings
-s and -ry¨
e may seem less similar than -n vs. -ny¨
e, it should be understood
that -ry¨
e would come from earlier -sye: Following a vowel, the combination
sy turns into zy and then ry. Cf. the Etymologies, entry sus; from this root,
Tolkien derived the Quenya word surya “spirant consonant”, which must
be understood to come from susyˆ
a in the primitive language.) The longer
ending -ry¨
e would be used primarily when a second pronominal ending
denoting the object is to be added, e.g., tiriryet “(s)he watches them” –
whereas “(s)he watches” by itself could be either tiris or tiriry¨
e, but more
commonly the former. But writers who want to avoid the unattested ending
-ry¨
e may opt for the gender-speciﬁc endings -ro and -r¨
e instead, to bring in
a connecting vowel: tirirot “he watches them”, tiriret “she watches them”.
In the exercises below, we will however avoid all speculative endings and
constructions and concentrate on the only known facts we have at our dis-
posal regarding the 3rd person singular of the pronoun table: In Quenya as
Tolkien had come to see this language in the post-LotR period, the end-
ing -s may be used for “he, she, it”, whereas -rya covers “his” and “her”.
(We may plausibly assume that -rya covers “its” as well: Notice that in the
phrase ringa s´
umaryass¨
e “in her cold bosom” cited above, the reference is
actually to a ship, so “its bosom” would seem to be an equally appropriate
translation.) The long endings -ro and -r¨
e are not used in the exercises or
the keys, since their status in LotR-style Quenya is slightly uncertain (not
that I necessarily discourage writers from using them).
Summary of Lesson Fifteen
The Quenya pronominal possessive ending for “his, her” is -rya, behaving
like the other endings of this kind (endings for number or case may be
added after it). If a dual noun is to receive a pronominal ending, its duality
is indicated by -t added to this ending (cf. m´
aryat “her [pair of] hands” in
Nam´
ari¨
e), apparently even in the case of nouns that would otherwise receive
the alternative dual marker -u instead. – The extended inﬁnitives in -ta
which may receive pronominal endings denoting the object (e.g. caritas “to
do it”) may also receive possessive pronominal endings denoting the subject,
e.g. caritalya(s) “your doing (it)”. – Nouns ending in a long vowel, e.g.
m´
a “hand”, would shorten this vowel before a consonant cluster; thus the
plural allative is attested as mannar (for the impossible form **m´
annar).
Curiously, long vowels are not shortened before ry, ly, ny, ty, though these
combinations do count as consonant clusters for the purpose of stress. –
The Quenya locative case has the ending -ss¨
e, plural -ssen, and dual -ts¨
e
(at least in the case of nouns with nominative dual forms in -t; nouns with
nominative dual forms in -u may simply add -ss¨
e). These endings express
the idea of “in”, “on”, “upon”, e.g. ciryass¨
e “(up)on a ship”, coassen
245


“in houses”. – Quenya relative sentences may be formed using the relative
pronoun ya “which, that”. Ya may also receive endings for case and number,
cf. the plural locative yassen “in which” or “wherein” occurring in Nam´
ari¨
e
(plural because it refers back to a plural word). The article i “the” may also
be used as a relative pronoun, cf. i Eru i or ily¨
e mahalmar ¨
ea tennoio,
“the One who is above all thrones” in Cirion’s Oath, but i apparently cannot
receive endings for case or number. In front of a verb, i can be used by itself
to express “the one(s) who do(es)” whatever the verb expresses, e.g., i carir
quettar “the ones/those who form words”. – The pronominal endings for
“he” and “she” are somewhat uncertain. Early material contains verbs with
the endings -ro “he” and -r¨
e “she” (often combined with lengthening of
the vowel of the preceding syllable). In post-LotR material, we have one
attestation of -s as an ending covering both “he” and “she”, and since the
same ending is attested with the meaning “it” elsewhere (as object), we may
assume that -s is a general ending covering the entire 3rd person singular,
as subject or object. One educated guess has it that this -s alternates with
a longer form -ry¨
e (plausibly extrapolated from the possessive ending -rya
“his/her”), but only the attested ending -s is used in the exercises below.
Vocabulary
tatya “second” (The original name of the Second Clan of the Elves was Tatyar,
literally “Seconds, Second Ones”, though the Eldarin branch of that clan would
later be called Noldor instead [WJ:380–381]. A variant form of tatya is atya
[attested, compounded, in VT41:10], which connects more clearly with the basic
number atta “two”. As will be explained in Lesson 17, “second” was later expressed
as att¨
ea, but students should know the archaic form tatya as well, and we will use
this form here.)
mar- “to dwell, abide”; to “live” somewhere in the sense of dwelling there
(cf. Elendil’s Declaration: sinom¨
e maruvan = “in this place will I abide”) ya
relative pronoun “that, which”, often with case endings; as relative pronoun alter-
nating with i (= “who”, referring to people and used when no ending for case or
number is to be added?)
aur¨
e “day” (the actual daylight period, not a full 24-hour cycle) veru “(married)
couple, man and wife, pair of spouses” (an old dual form apparently lacking
any singular; there are only the gender-speciﬁc words verno “husband” and vess¨
e
“wife” from the same root)
m´
a “hand”
p´
e “lip”, nominative dual peu (so according to VT39:9, reproducing a post-LotR
source. Earlier, in the entry peg of the Etymologies, the word p´
e had been glossed
“mouth” instead – which would be pure plagiarism of the Hebrew word for “mouth”!
But Tolkien apparently thought better of it: in LotR Appendix E, the Quenya word
for “mouth” is given as anto instead, which word we introduced in Lesson Eleven.)
246


mall¨
e “road, street” (nominative pl. maller, LR:47, 56; SD:310 – as we theorized in
Lesson Two, nouns in -l¨
e may regularly have plural forms in -ler rather than -li.)
hr´
ıv¨
e “winter”
apa preposition “after” (only attested compounded; cf. Apan´
onar “the Afterborn”
as an Elvish name of Men, the Elves themselves being the Firstborn – see the
Silmarillion, near the beginning of chapter 12. We will here assume that apa may
also function as an independent preposition.)
Hyarmen “the South”
hyarya adjective “left”
NOTE: As suggested by their shapes, the words for “south” and “left” are closely
related. As explained by Tolkien in LotR Appendix E, the four directions N´
umen,
Hyarmen, R´
omen, Formen = West, South, East, North were normally listed in that
order, “beginning with and facing west” – apparently because that was the direction of the
Blessed Realm. It may be no coincidence that the directions are listed counterclockwise so
that the North is named last, for in the First Age when this convention was presumably es-
tablished, North was the direction of Morgoth’s stronghold (Angband or Thangorodrim).
Our imaginary speaker facing the West would have the South on his left hand, and Tolkien
explained that Hyarmen means basically “left-hand region”. As Tolkien also noted, this
system is “the opposite to the arrangement in many Mannish languages”, which tend
rather to use the East (the direction of the sunrise) as the starting-point “faced” by the
speaker. Thus the words for “south” and “right” may be associated or identical – cf. for
instance Hebrew yamˆ
ın.

Lesson 16
The Instrumental case. Verbs with an unaccented vowel +
-ta. The imperative. The nai formula.
If we accept the information provided in the Plotz letter as Tolkien’s deﬁnite
version of Quenya case system, we have now discussed all the Quenya noun
cases except two. One of them is somewhat obscure; Tolkien supplied no
further information about it, not even telling us what this case is called. The
relevant ending is -s, plural -is. The Plotz lay-out suggests that this “Mystery
Case” is simply a shorter, alternative version of the locative: The word
exemplifying this case is listed in a parenthesis below the locative form of the
same word. So instead of coass¨
e “in a house”, plural coassen “in houses”,
one may perhaps use the shorter forms coas, pl. coais. However, since we
cannot be entirely conﬁdent regarding the function of this case, I will not
construct any exercises involving it. On the other hand, the function of the
last Quenya case we will discuss in this course is relatively well understood.
We are talking about:
16.1
The Instrumental case
The rule for how the instrumental case is constructed can (for pedagogical
purposes!) be stated very simply: Just add -en to the dative form! So where
the dative has the ending -n, corresponding to plural -in and dual -nt,
the instrumental has the endings -nen, plural -inen, dual -nten. Before
discussing the function of this case, we will ﬁll in some more details about
the instrumental forms as such.
We must assume that the basic instrumental ending -nen can be added
directly to nouns ending in -n and -r without creating impossible clusters,
so that we could have elennen as the instrumental form of elen “star”, or
Anarnen as the instrumental of Anar “Sun”. (These instrumental forms
would of course be accented on the second-to-last syllable because of the
consonants cluster -nn- or -rn- now following the vowel of this syllable.)
Nouns ending in -s with stems in -r- (for older -z-) would probably also
show -rn- in the instrumental, e.g. olornen as the instrumental form of
249


olos, olor- “dream”. Nouns in -n with stems in -m- must be assumed to
have instrumental forms in -mnen, e.g. talamnen as the instrumental form
of talan, talam- “ﬂoor”. But from this point, we can’t be sure. Since the
group ln regularly becomes ld in Quenya, it could be that the instrumental
form of (say) estel “trust, hope” should be ?estelden for older estelnen.
Otherwise, as in the case of nouns in -t, it becomes even more diﬃcult.
What is the instrumental form of a noun like nat “thing”? Since **natnen
is not a possible Quenya form, would it turn into ?nanten with metathesis
tn > nt, or would a connecting vowel (possibly -e-) materialize to produce
a form like natenen? In the case of nouns with special stem-forms ending in
consonant clusters, a connecting vowel must be inserted before the ending
-nen; the instrumental form of n´
ıs (niss-) “woman” may be something like
nissenen.
Some otherwise long-lost ﬁnal vowel may also be preserved before case-
endings, as when ambar “fate, doom” is seen to have the instrumental form
ambartanen (the relevant example is further discussed below). The stem
of ambar may be given as ambart(a)-: Presumably the word did end in
-rta way back in primitive Elvish, but except when shielded by grammatical
endings, the ﬁnal vowel and (later) the -t had been lost.
If the plural ending -inen is added to a noun ending in one of the three
vowels -a, -o, or -u, the initial -i- of the ending merges with the last vowel of
the noun to form a diphthong. Constituting the new second-to-last syllable,
it naturally attracts the stress. Thus WJ:391 has ´
omainen as the plural
instrumental form of ´
oma “voice”, the form ´
omainen being accented on
the diphthong -ai-. Nouns ending in -¨
e may originally have behaved in a
similar fashion, so that lass¨
e “leaf” once had the plural instrumental form
lasseinen, accented on the diphthong ei – but in Quenya, older ei eventually
turned into a long ´
ı, and the Plotz letter points to lass´
ınen as the current
form. Of course, this long ´
ı still attracts the stress, like any long vowel
occurring in the second-to-last syllable of a word. It is possible that nouns
ending in -i, like t´
ari “queen”, would also show´
ı in their plural instrumental
forms, t´
ari+inen manifesting as t´
ar´
ınen since two short i’s would merge into
one long ´
ı. This plural form t´
ar´
ınen, accented on the ´
ı in the second-to-
last syllable, would then contrast with the singular t´
arinen, accented on
t´
ar-. Nouns in -¨
e with stem-forms in -i may behave in a similar fashion.
The singular instrumental form of the noun l´
ır¨
e, l´
ıri- “song” is attested
in Nam´
ari¨
e as l´
ırinen (this would be simply l´
ıri+nen); perhaps the plural
form would be l´
ır´
ınen (for l´
ıri+inen).
For the last time in the course proper I must bore the student with the
question of dual forms: Some dual instrumentals have the ending -nten as
indicated by Plotz, but the dual element is obviously the t, intruding into
the simplest instrumental ending -nen. So is the ending -nten peculiar to
nouns with nominative dual forms in -t, so that nouns with nominative dual
forms in -u would rather add the simplest ending -nen after this -u? I tend
250


to think so; the instrumental form of Aldu “Two Trees” would then be
Aldunen rather than ?Aldunten (or ?Aldanten or whatever).
As the name suggests, the function of the instrumental case is to identify
the “instrument” (in a wide sense) by which some action is achieved. The
best example available is probably the phrase i carir quettar ´
omainen
“those who make words with voices” (WJ:391). This description of the Elves,
involving the plural instrumental form of ´
oma “voice”, identiﬁes their voices
as the “instrument” or means by which they make words. Lacking an instru-
mental case, English often uses the preposition “with” instead, as in Tolkiens
translation of ´
omainen: “with voices”. However, it should be understood
that the Quenya instrumental endings correspond to English “with” only
where this preposition means “using” or “by means of” (i carir quettar
´
omainen could also be translated “those who make words using voices”).
It is highly unlikely that the endings marking the instrumental case can
be used for English “with” in the sense of “together with” (and please allow
me to dwell on this point for a moment, for some writers have actually
misapplied the Quenya instrumental case in such a way!) A sentence like “I
saw them with an Elf” can hardly be translated as **cennenyet Eldanen,
for to the extent this makes any sense at all, it implies that the Elf is
the instrument by which “I saw them”! On the other hand, in a sentence
like “I saw them with my binoculars”, it would be quite all right to use the
instrumental case for the English preposition “with”. (Unfortunately, I can’t
reconstruct the actual Quenya wording, for Tolkien doesn’t seem to mention
any Elvish word for “binoculars” anywhere: Perhaps the far-sighted Elves
just didn’t need such artiﬁces!)
The Quenya instrumental endings may also be rendered into English by
means of other prepositions than “with”. The two instrumental forms oc-
curring in Nam´
ari¨
e Tolkien translated as phrases involving the preposition
“in”; yet it is clear from the context that the instrumental does not really
intrude on the area otherwise covered by the locative. The ﬁrst instrumental
form occurs at the end of the ﬁrst line of the song: Ai! lauri¨
e lantar lassi
s´
urinen, “ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind”. Despite Tolkien’s trans-
lation, the context indicates that the “wind” (s´
ur¨
e, s´
uri-) is here thought
of as the “instrument” which makes the leaves fall: “In the wind” actually
implies “by means of the wind”, or simply “because of the wind”. This ex-
ample shows that the Quenya instrumental case may indicate simply the
reason why something happens (the instrumental ending marking the noun
denoting what makes it happen). The second example of the instrumental
case in Nam´
ari¨
e is similar, involving the noun l´
ır¨
e, l´
ıri- “song”: Quoting
from the prose version in RGEO, reference is made to Vardo . . . tellumar,
yassen tintilar i eleni ´
omaryo l´
ırinen, that is, “Varda’s . . . domes, in
which the stars twinkle by the song of her voice” (´
omaryo l´
ırinen = “her
voice’s song-by”). So the song of Varda’s voice is what makes the stars twin-
kle, and the word for “song” is accordingly marked with the instrumental
251


ending -nen.
Another instrumental ending translated “in” by Tolkien is found in F´
ıriel’s
Song, one line of which says that the Valar gave everyone the gifts of Il´
uvatar
lestanen = “in measure”. Here the instrumental noun tells us something
about how the verbal action was accomplished.
The Markirya poem includes the plural instrumental form (ending -inen)
of the word r´
ama “wing”, the sails of a ship being poetically referred to as
its “wings”: The ship is described as wilwarin wilwa . . . r´
amainen elvi¨
e,
meaning something like “ﬂuttering like a butterﬂy . . . on starlike wings” (or,
“with starlike wings”, “by means of starlike wings”). We could imagine a less
poetical example using the same plural instrumental form, e.g. aiwi vilir
r´
amainen, “birds ﬂy with (or, using) wings”. Talking about a single bird
we could use a dual instrumental form: aiw¨
e vil¨
e r´
amanten, “a bird ﬂies
with [a pair of] wings”.
One (actually the only) example of an instrumental form occurring in
the Silmarillion is particularly interesting. Near the end of chapter 21, Of
T´
urin Turambar, N´
ıniel refers to her brother as Turambar turun ambar-
tanen, “master of doom by doom mastered”. UT:138 indicates that the
more proper reading is Turambar tur´
un’ ambartanen. This sentence is
peculiar for several reasons. The word for “doom” (= “fate”) is here am-
bar with stem ambart(a)-, as in the name Turambar “master of doom”
and the instrumental form ambartanen “by doom”. Other sources point to
umbar as the Quenya word for “fate, doom” (it is even mentioned in LotR
Appendix E as the name of a Tengwa letter). Ambar elsewhere occurs with
the meaning “world”, as in Elendil’s Declaration in LotR (where reference
is made to the Ambar-metta or “end of the world”), but ambar “doom”
only partially coincides with this noun, since the stem-form ambart(a)- is
distinct. Conceivably the “proper” Quenya word for “doom” was umbar,
but the variant form ambar appeared in Exilic Quenya because of inﬂu-
ence from the corresponding Sindarin word (ammarth or amarth). We must
have faith: perhaps Tolkien explains the seeming discrepancies in some still
unpublished note.
Another peculiar feature of N´
ıniel’s cry is the word turun or more prop-
erly tur´
un’, translated “mastered”. The translation would seem to indicate
that this is a passive participle, and the complete form must be tur´
una,
the ﬁnal -a here dropping out because the next word (ambartanen) begins
in the same vowel. This form tur´
un[a] “mastered” must be related to the
verb tur- “govern, control, wield” that we introduced in Lesson Seven. How-
ever, according to the rules for the formation of passive participles set out
in Lesson Ten, the participle of tur- ought to be turna (cf. carna “made”
as the attested passive participle of car- “make”), or less likely t´
urina
(cf. r´
acina “broken” as the attested participle of rac- “break”). The form
tur´
un[a] is quite perplexing. It could belong to some peculiar phase in
Tolkien’s evolution of Quenya, an experiment later abandoned. Since we are
252


dealing with posthumously published material here, we can never be certain
that all the linguistic samples represent the Professor’s deﬁnitive decisions
on what Quenya grammar was “really” like.
We must hope that future publications will throw more light upon the
strange form tur´
un[a], but if we accept it as some kind of passive partici-
ple, we can make out one important grammatical rule from N´
ıniel’s cry:
Following a passive participle, the agent who brought about the condition
described can be introduced as a noun in the instrumental case. In our at-
tested example, T´
urin Turambar was “mastered”, and since N´
ıniel wanted to
add information about what it was that “mastered” her brother, she used
the instrumental form ambartanen = “by doom”. A less gloomy exam-
ple could involve, say, t´
ecina “written”, the passive participle of the verb
tec- “to write”: We could build a phrase like i parma t´
ecina i Eldanen,
“the book written by the Elf”. Following a participle, the instrumental form
could surely also assume its more basic function of denoting an instrument,
so that we could have a phrase like t´
ecina quessenen “written with a
feather [pen]” (quess¨
e = “feather”).
We must assume that the instrumental endings can be added to the rel-
ative pronoun ya- to express “by which”, “with which”: Singular i cirya
yanen lenden amba i s´
ır¨
e “the ship by which I went up the river” (amba
= “up”), plural i ciryar yainen. . . “the ships by which. . . ”, dual i ciryat
yanten. . . “the couple of ships by which. . . ”
Though our attested examples involve other cases, there is no reason
to doubt that also instrumental endings can be combined with possessive
pronominal endings – producing forms like m´
anyanen “with my hand”,
“using my hand” (m´
a-nya-nen “hand-my-with”).
Combined with a gerund (ending in -i¨
e), the instrumental case may per-
haps express the idea of “by doing so and so”, e.g. tiri´
enen “by watch-
ing” (for instance, in a sentence like “I found out by watching”). When
the instrumental ending is added to nouns in -i¨
e, the vowel in front of the
ending would likely be lengthened, thus receiving the accent (a quite awk-
ward stress-pattern being avoided): Hence I go for tiri´
enen rather than
?tirienen, which would have to be accented on the second i. We have no
attested example involving the instrumental case, but cf. Tolkien’s tyali´
eva
as the possessive form of tyali¨
e “play”. The instrumental would likely be
tyali´
enen, then. Such vocalic lengthening – apparently to avoid cumber-
some stress-patterns – is also observed in other parts of speech, as we will
discover in the next thrilling section:
16.2
Verbs with an unaccented vowel + -ta
We have earlier discussed what must be the main categories of Quenya verbs.
There are some minor sub-groups of verbs that may have their own peculiar
253


features, but our knowledge is very limited since (the litany of Tolkienan
linguistics:) we have so few examples. All the same, a few observations about
some of these sub-categories may be made, and we will deal with one of them
here.
In some of my examples and exercises I have combined the verb car-
“make, do” with an adjective, e.g. exercise C in the previous lesson: Hiri-
taryas carn¨
e lierya alya, “his ﬁnding it made his people rich”. I should
point out that we have no Tolkien-made example of an adjective being com-
bined with car- in such a way, and it may be that I am here imposing an
English idiom on Quenya. Now this may not be such a disaster: If we are
ever to develop a usable form of Quenya, it would almost inevitably become
somewhat coloured by modern usage (and if the Eldar return from Valinor
to protest against their language being mistreated, that would not be a bad
thing, either). Even so, it may be noted that Quenya vocabulary includes
what may be termed causative verbs derived from adjectives; perhaps fully
“idiomatic” Quenya would rather use such formations.
These verbs express, in a single word, the idea of “making” an object have
the properties described by the corresponding adjective. The student should
already be familiar with the ending -ta, which occurs in many Quenya verbs
(e.g. pusta- “to stop”). Often it is just a verbal ending with no particular
implications, but occasionally it may take on a causative meaning; compare
the primary verb tul- “to come” and the derived verb tulta- “to summon”
(= to cause to come). Added to adjectives, it seems that this ending may
similarly be used to derive causative verbs. We have only a handful of exam-
ples, but the adjective air¨
e “holy” apparently corresponds to a verb airita-
“to hallow” – that is, “to make holy”. (The ﬁnal -¨
e of air¨
e “holy” appears
as -i- in airita- because the -¨
e of air¨
e descends from -i in the primitive
language, and it changed to -¨
e only when ﬁnal. Cf. the similar variation in
the aorist: sil¨
e “shines”, but with a plural subject silir “shine”, because if
you add any ending the ﬁnal vowel is no longer ﬁnal at all.)
The one form of the verb airita- that is actually attested is the past tense.
It reportedly appears as airit´
an¨
e in an unpublished Tolkien manuscript
stored at the Bodleian: According to a footnote in Vinyar Tengwar #32,
November 1993, p. 7, the manuscript page in question “dates to c. 1966
and gives much information about Quenya verbs. It will be published in
an upcoming issue of Vinyar Tengwar.” Eight years and nine Vinyar Teng-
wars later, we are unfortunately still waiting to see this apparently highly
interesting document – but at least VT#32 cited the past tense airit´
an¨
e.
It obviously includes the well-known past tense ending -n¨
e, but it should
be noted that the vowel of the ending -ta- is here lengthened when the past
tense ending is added. In this way, the now long syllable -t´
a- attracts the
stress. **Airitan¨
e with no lengthening would have a rather awkward stress-
pattern (accented on -rit-), and it is perhaps for this reason the lengthening
occurs. This may also imply that if some further ending is added after -n¨
e so
254


that the stress would not threaten to land on -rit- after all, the lengthening
of -ta- may not occur: Perhaps, say, “we hallowed” is airitanelm¨
e rather
than ?airit´
anelm¨
e, since the stress must here fall on -ne- and -ta- receives
no stress at all. Some think Quenya cannot have a long vowel in a wholly
unaccented syllable unless this syllable is also the ﬁrst one of the word.
Whatever the case may be, we can apparently infer this rule: As long as
the past tense form of such a verb (that is, a verb with an unaccented vowel
in front of the verbal ending -ta) is not to receive any further endings that
may shift the stress, the ending -ta is lengthened to -t´
a- when the past
tense ending -n¨
e is added after it: Thus airit´
an¨
e as the pa.t. of airita-.
Of course, not all endings that may be suﬃxed to -n¨
e have the power to
shift the stress, and then the lengthening of -t´
a- must remain to prevent
the accent from going someplace it shouldn’t: Airit´
aner “hallowed” (with
a plural subject), airit´
anes “(s)he hallowed”, airit´
anen “I hallowed”. But
quite possibly, it should be airitaneny¨
e with no lengthening of -t´
a- if you
use the longer form of the ending for “I” – so that the stress moves to -ne-,
and -ta- becomes a wholly unaccented syllable.
In the Etymologies, Tolkien listed at least one more verb that seems to
belong to this class. The entry nik-w- provides a verb ninquit´
a- “whiten”,
i.e. “make white”, derived from the adjective “white”: ninqu¨
e (stem nin-
qui-; the primitive form is given as ninkwi). By writing ninquit´
a-, Tolkien
obviously suggested that the ﬁnal vowel is often long, and we may safely
assume that the past tense is ninquit´
an¨
e.
NOTE: In the entry nik-w-, Tolkien also listed a verb ninquita- “shine white” that
would probably inﬂect otherwise: perhaps the past tense would rather be ?ninquint¨
e with
nasal inﬁxion (allow me to state explicitly that this is speculation!) In the aorist, the two
verbs must probably coincide as ninquita, the context determining whether this is to be
interpreted “whitens” or “shines white”.
We may be able to tell one more thing about this class of verbs: how the
passive (or “past”) participle is formed. The evidence is widely scattered,
though.
In The Houses of Healing, Chapter 8 of Book Five in The Return of the
King, Tolkien has Aragorn saying that “in the high tongue of old I am
Elessar, the Elfstone, and Envinyatar, the Renewer”. The Quenya title En-
vinyatar = “Renewer” is interesting. As for the ﬁnal -r seen here, this
ending may be added to (A-stem) Quenya verbs with much the same mean-
ing as the English agent ending -er, so Envinyatar “Renewer” points to
an underlying verb envinyata- “to renew”. The preﬁx en- means “re-”,
and vinya is the Quenya adjective “new”, so apparently we are looking at
another verb derived from an adjective by means of the ending -ta.
Interestingly, what may be seen as the passive participle of this verb
envinyata- “to renew” is attested in MR:405, in the phrase Arda En-
vinyanta. This Tolkien translated “Arda Healed” (the reference is to a
future world healed from the consequences of the evil of Morgoth). Compar-
255


ing it with Aragorn’s title Envinyatar = “Renewer”, we can tell that Arda
Envinyanta more literally means “Arda Renewed”. It should be noted how
the passive participle is formed: by nasal-inﬁxion intruding before the t of
the ending -ta of the verb envinyata-. The resulting form envinyanta dif-
fers from the passive participles of “normal” verbs in -ta, which seem to
have participles in -taina. (Compare hastaina “marred” from the same
text that provides the example Arda Envinyanta “Arda Healed”: Arda
Hastaina or “Arda Marred” was the world as it actually appeared, marred
by Morgoth. See MR:405, cf. 408, note 14. It is important to notice that
these divergent types of participles occur in the same source text, allowing
us to know with certainty that the diﬀerent formations do belong to the
same version of Quenya: Otherwise, it would be tempting to dismiss some of
the formations as representing merely a certain stage in Tolkien’s evolution
of the language – ideas he later abandoned.)
If envinyata- “to renew” has the passive participle envinyanta, we
may plausibly assume that the pass. part. of airita- “to hallow” is sim-
ilarly formed by means of nasal-inﬁxion: airinta “hallowed” (rather than
?airitaina, though perhaps this form would also be acceptable). And if
airita- has the past tense form airit´
an¨
e with lengthening of -ta- to -t´
a-, we
can probably assume that envinyata- “to renew” becomes envinyat´
an¨
e in
the past tense. Similarly, if ninquit´
a- is the verb “to whiten”, with the past
tense ninquit´
an¨
e, the participle “whitened” may well be ninquinta. (The
forms envinyanta, airinta, ninquinta would of course agree in number
like adjectives in -a, changing this ﬁnal vowel to -¨
e in the plural.)
We have mentioned pretty much all the very few known verbs that may
tentatively be assigned to this sub-class. There is no direct evidence for how
they would behave in other forms than the past tense and the passive par-
ticiple. (As for the active participle in -la, we would almost certainly see the
same lengthening of the ending -ta as we observe before the past tense end-
ing -n¨
e: hence airit´
ala “hallowing”, envinyat´
ala “renewing”. Again, the
“motivation” for lengthening the vowel of -ta would be to achieve euphonic
stress-patterns.)
It is of course diﬃcult to know to what extent we should feel free to derive
new Quenya verbs ourselves by adding -ta to adjectives (remembering that
adjectives in -¨
e change this vowel to -i- before endings, as in airita- “to
hallow” from air¨
e “holy”). To return to the sentence we started with, hir-
itaryas carn¨
e lierya alya “his ﬁnding it made his people rich”, perhaps
this might better be expressed as hiritaryas alyat´
an¨
e lierya? We then
assume that the adjective alya- can be used as the basis for a verb alyata-
“make rich” or “enrich”, with past tense alyat´
an¨
e (and passive participle
alyanta). In this as in other matters, people who want to write in Quenya
face a diﬃcult choice: Should we try to make the language work using solely
the words Tolkien himself provided, introducing unattested idioms or long
circumlocutions where necessary to work around gaps in the Tolkien-made
256


vocabulary? Or should we feel free to derive new words from Tolkienian ele-
ments by applying the Professor’s principles as far as we understand them,
something that may be perceived as diluting Tolkien’s actual linguistic out-
put with “fake” elements (however cleverly constructed)? Some post-Tolkien
creativity must unquestionably be allowed if we are ever to develop Quenya
into anything like a useable language, but there are no easy answers here.
16.3
The imperative
The imperative is a form of the verb used to express commands or requests.
In English, imperatives are often preceded by the word “please” to make
them more polite, but it should be understood that an imperative form as
such is not necessarily to be taken as a blunt order. In Tolkien’s Quenya
rendering of the Lord’s Prayer, several imperatives occur, and such a prayer
as “deliver us from evil” is of course just that – a prayer, not an attempt to
order God around.
According to Tolkien, the primitive Elvish language had an imperative
particle that could be used in conjunction with a verbal stem to indicate
that it was to be taken as an imperative. The particle had the form ˆ
a, and it
was “originally independent and variable in place” (WJ:365). Sometimes it
was placed after the stem, and in such cases it came out as an ending -a in
Quenya. WJ:364 mentions an “imperative exclamation” heca! meaning “be
gone!” or “stand aside!” – and on the next page, this is suggested to come
from the primitive phrase hek(e) ˆ
a. There is also the primitive exclamation
el-ˆ
a, “lo!”, “look!”, “see!”, which is supposed to be the very ﬁrst thing the
Elves ever said as they awoke at Cuivi´
enen and ﬁrst saw the stars (WJ:360).
In Quenya, this word came out as ela! It was “an imperative exclamation
directing sight to an actually visible object” (WJ:362).
If we were to be guided by examples like heca and ela, we would have
to conclude that in the case of primary verbs at least, imperatives may be
formed by adding -a to the verbal stem. For instance, tir- “to watch” would
have the imperative tira! “watch!”, representing primitive tir-ˆ
a or tir(i) ˆ
a.
The corresponding Sindarin form tiro! is actually attested. (Notice that the
imperative tira “watch!” would be distinct from the present/continuative
form t´
ıra “is watching”, since in the latter form, the stem-vowel is length-
ened.) This may be one way of constructing Quenya imperatives, but it is
also possible that exclamations like heca and ela are to be taken as “fos-
silized” forms descending from earlier stages of Elvish.
As for the typical “modern” way of forming imperatives, there is some
evidence that a descendant of the original particle ˆ
a was still treated as an
independent word: it was placed in front of the verbal stem instead of be-
ing suﬃxed as an ending. In the LotR itself, an example is provided by the
Cormallen Praise, the crowd hailing Frodo and Sam with the words a laita
257


te. . . Cormacolindor, a laita t´
arienna! “Bless them. . . The Ring bear-
ers, bless (or praise) them to the height” (translated in Letters:308). Notice
how the verbal stem laita- “bless, praise” is here preceded by the imperative
particle a to form an imperative phrase a laita! “bless!” or “praise!” The
particle a also appears in the long form ´
a, directly from primitive ˆ
a, as in
the exclamation ´
a vala Manw¨
e! “may Manw¨
e order it!” (WJ:404). Here,
the verb vala- “rule, govern” (the origin of the noun Valar and in later
usage therefore referring to “divine” power only) is combined with the im-
perative particle ´
a: The literal meaning of ´
a vala Manw¨
e! is transparently
something like “do rule Manw¨
e!”, if we make an eﬀort to translate ´
a as a
separate word. Incidentally, this example demonstrates that the subject of
the imperative (the one who is to carry out the “order” or request) may be
explicitly mentioned after the imperative phrase proper.
Is there any reason why the imperative particle appears in the short form
a in a laita, but in the long form ´
a in ´
a vala? It has been suggested that
´
a is shortened to a whenever it occurs in front of a long syllable (like lai-,
because of the diphthong ai), but we cannot be sure. Perhaps ´
a vs. a is just
an example of random variation: Presumably being unaccented, the particle
could well tend to become shortened if speakers don’t enunciate with care
(the ecstatic crowds at Cormallen, hailing the hobbits who had saved the
world, hardly did!) I would normally prefer the long form ´
a, avoiding con-
fusion with a as a particle of address, like English “o” (as in Treebeard’s
greeting to Celeborn and Galadriel: a vanimar = “o beautiful ones”, Let-
ters:308). For instance, since the verb “to go” is lelya-, the imperative “go!”
would be ´
a lelya!
The imperative particle ´
a can also be combined with the negation v´
a
to form the word ´
ava, used in negative commands: ´
Ava car¨
e! “Don’t do
[it]!” (WJ:371). This example also gives away how primary verbs behave in
imperative phrases: they appear with the ending -¨
e, just like they do when
they are used as inﬁnitives (and ending-less aorist forms). So from a primary
verb like tir- “watch”, we can probably form a command like ´
a tir¨
e! “(do)
watch!” – negative ´
ava tir¨
e! “don’t watch!”
16.4
The nai formula
If one does not want to issue a command (however polite), but is merely
expressing a wish that something will be done or will happen, Quenya has
a special “wishing formula”.
Near the end of Nam´
ari¨
e, we ﬁnd these lines: Nai hiruvaly¨
e Valimar!
Nai ely¨
e hiruva! In LotR, this is translated “maybe thou wilt ﬁnd Valimar!
Maybe even thou wilt ﬁnd it!” The word nai is here rendered into English
as “maybe”, but elsewhere, Tolkien indicated that this Quenya word does
not merely imply that something is possible. He noted that nai “expresses
258


rather a wish than a hope, and would be more closely rendered ‘may it be
that’ (thou wilt ﬁnd), than by ‘maybe.’” (RGEO:68) We may wonder why
he used the “misleading” translation maybe in the ﬁrst place; possibly there
are some “conceptual developments” involved here (i.e., Tolkien changed his
mind about the precise meaning of a Quenya text he had already published!)
Anyway, his ﬁnal decision on the meaning of the phrase nai hiruvaly¨
e
Valimar was that it is to be interpreted “be it that thou wilt ﬁnd Valimar”
or “may thou ﬁnd Valimar”. Nai ely¨
e hiruva likewise means “be it that
even thou wilt ﬁnd [it]”. (The word ely¨
e “even thou” here occurring is an
emphatic, independent pronoun corresponding to the ending -ly¨
e “thou,
you”, whereas Valimar here stands as an alternative to Valinor: Galadriel
singing Nam´
ari¨
e thus expresses a wish that Frodo will eventually “ﬁnd” or
come to the Blessed Realm – and as we remember, both he and Galadriel
herself went over the Sea in the end.)
We have one more attestation of the nai wishing-formula. It occurs in
Cirion’s Oath, Cirion expressing a wish that the Valar will guard the oath:
Nai tiruvantes, “be it that they will guard [/watch over] it”. Tolkien noted
that this is the equivalent of “may they guard it” (UT:305, 317).
As for the basic meaning of the word nai itself, Tolkien implied that it
is quite literally “be (it) that”: He derived Quenya nai from earlier nˆ
a-i
(RGEO:68). The nˆ
a part would seem to be the element meaning “be!”,
undoubtedly closely related to the Quenya copula n´
a “is”, itself a form of
the verb “to be”. The ﬁnal i must be the element corresponding to the
“that” of “be (it) that”, and this i is certainly meant to be related to the
Quenya article i “the”.
Whatever the precise origin or basic meaning of nai may be, it is a useful
word that can apparently be put in front of any sentence including a future-
tense verb, turning a simple statement about the future into a wish about
what the future may bring:
• Elda tuluva coalmanna “an Elf will come to our house” > Nai
Elda tuluva coalmanna! “be it that an Elf will come to our house!”
= “(I) wish that an Elf will come to our house!” or “may an Elf come
to our house!”
• Hiruvan i malta “I will ﬁnd the gold” > Nai hiruvan i malta! “be
it that I will ﬁnd gold!” = “wish that I will ﬁnd the gold!”
• Caruvantes “they will do it” > nai caruvantes! “be it that they
will do it!” = “wish that they will do it!”
In our attested examples, nai is combined with the future tense, but since
we have only three examples, it certainly cannot be ruled out that nai may
be used in conjunction with other tenses as well. (One may even say we
have only two examples, Cirion’s Oath + Nam´
ari¨
e, since the two examples
of the nai formula near the end of Nam´
ari¨
e are very similar.) Perhaps nai
259


can also describe the speaker’s hope that a certain wish is already being
fulﬁlled, or has been fulﬁlled in the past – the speaker still not knowing
whether the wish came true or not. If so, we could have constructions like
nai t´
ıras “be it that (s)he is watching” = “I hope (s)he is watching” (with
the present or continuative tense of tir- “watch”), nai hirnentes! “be it
that they found it” = “I hope they found it” (with the past tense of hir-
“ﬁnd”), or nai ut´
ulies “be it that (s)he has come” = “I hope (s)he’s come”
(with the perfect tense of tul- “come”). However, in the exercises below,
nai is only combined with the future tense – as in our attested examples.
Summary of Lesson Sixteen
The instrumental case has the basic ending -nen, plural -inen, dual -nten
(at least in the case of nouns with nominative dual forms in -t; nouns with
dual forms in -u may just add the simplest ending -nen to this vowel). The
instrumental ending is added to nouns denoting the “instrument” or means
by which some action is done or accomplished, as when Elves are described
as making words ´
omainen = “with voices” (´
oma “voice”). The instrumen-
tal ending may correspond to such English prepositions as “with” or “by”
where these words mean “using”, “by means of”. Sometimes the instru-
mental ending may mark a noun simply indicating what makes something
happen, as when the ﬁrst line of Nam´
ari¨
e says leaves fall s´
urinen = “in the
wind”, i.e., because of the wind. Following a passive participle, a noun in
the instrumental case may indicate who or what brought about the situation
described, as when T´
urin is described as tur´
un’ ambartanen, “mastered
by doom”. – Verbs including an unaccented vowel + the ending -ta seem to
have past-tense forms in -t´
an¨
e (notice the long ´
a) and passive participles
in -nta. Attested examples include airit´
an¨
e, past tense of airita- “to hal-
low”, and envinyanta, passive participle of envinyata- “to renew, heal”.
These verbs are causative formations derived from adjectives by means of
the ending -ta, as when air¨
e (airi-) “holy” is the basis of the causative verb
airita- “to make holy” = “to hallow”. – Quenya imperatives are marked
by the particle ´
a (variant a, negative ´
ava “don’t”), which is placed in front
of the verbal stem: A laita = “(do) praise!”, ´
a vala “(do) rule!” In this
grammatical context, the stem of primary verbs assume the ending -¨
e, as
in the negative command ´
ava car¨
e “don’t do [it]!” A few (old, fossilized?)
imperative forms are seen to replace the independent imperative particle ´
a
or a with the corresponding ending -a (ela “lo! behold!”, heca! “be gone!”)
– The word nai, meaning “be it that. . . ”, can be placed at the beginning of
a sentence to express a wish: Nai tiruvantes “be it that they will guard it”
or “may they guard it” (cf. tiruvantes “they will guard/watch it”). In our
attested examples, nai is placed in front of sentences including a future-tense
verb; whether nai can be combined with other tenses is unclear.

Lesson 17
The demonstratives: Sina, tan(y)a, enta, yana. Inﬂecting
the “Last Declinable Word”. U-stem nouns. Ordinals in -¨
ea.
17.1
Quenya demonstratives
”Demonstratives” are such words as English this or that, with the corre-
sponding plural forms these and those. Thus, they have a stronger meaning
than the mere article the (though in the languages of the world, many deﬁni-
tive articles descend from older demonstratives that were overused so that
their meaning faded). The demonstratives may be used together with nouns,
producing phrases like “this house” or “that man”.
In LotR-style Quenya we have only one demonstrative attested in an ac-
tual text: Cirion’s Oath commences with the words vanda sina, translated
“this oath”. The Quenya word order is actually “oath this”, sina being the
word for “this”: The root si- has to do with present position in time or space
(cf. such words as s´
ı “now” or sinom¨
e “in this place” = “here”, the latter
from Elendil’s Declaration in LotR).
A word for “that” appears as tanya in an early “Qenya” text published
in MC:215, which has tanya wende for “that maiden”. Here, the word-
order is “English-style” with the demonstrative ﬁrst and the noun it qualiﬁes
following it – the opposite of the word order seen in Cirion’s Oath. Perhaps
the word order is free, so that vanda sina could just as well be sina vanda
– and conversely, tanya wende could also be wende tanya? Be that as it
may, we cannot be quite certain that the word tanya is still valid in LotR-
style Quenya. The Etymologies lists ta as the Elvish “demonstrative stem
‘that’,” and the actual Quenya word for “that” is given as tana. Since this
form seems like a perfect counterpart to sina “this”, we will here use tana
rather than tanya as the word for “that” (though it is also possible that the
“Qenya” form tanya survived into the later stages of Tolkien’s conception).
So given that vanda sina is “this oath”, we must assume that “that oath”
would be vanda tana. Maybe we should update the “Qenya” phrase tanya
wende “that maiden” to LotR-style Quenya vend¨
e tana (or wend¨
e tana
with the older form or archaic spelling of the word for “maiden”). Then we
263


also implement the word-order seen in Cirion’s Oath, with the demonstrative
following rather than preceding the noun it connects with: In the entry ta
in the Etym, Tolkien actually described tana an anaphoric word for “that”,
meaning that it refers back to something already mentioned.
However, sina “this” and tan(y)a “that” are not the only Quenya demon-
stratives known. Though not actually observed in any Quenya texts, other
demonstratives are mentioned in Tolkien’s notes. Another word for “that”
is enta, mentioned in the entry en in the Etymologies and there described
as an adjective meaning “that yonder”. The root en itself is said to be an
“element or preﬁx = over there, yonder”. Still letting the demonstrative fol-
low the noun it connects with, we may perhaps construct a phrase like coa
enta, expressing “that house” in the sense of “yonder house”, “that house
over there”.
It may be that Tolkien meant Quenya to distinguish three degrees of
nearness or remoteness, as do certain languages of our own world. English
typically only distinguishes two degrees, “this” and “that”: To simplify mat-
ters rather drastically, we may say that “this” refers to something near the
speaker, whereas “that” refers to something away from the speaker. But in
some languages, the position of the listener is also considered. There are
two words for “that”, one referring to something away from the speaker but
near the person addressed (“that thing over by you”) and another word
referring to something that is not close to either the speaker or the listener
(“that thing we see over there”). Could it be that in Quenya, tana as a
word for “that” refers to something close to the person addressed, whereas
enta refers to something that is remote from both the speaker and the per-
son (s)he addresses? There is presently little or no evidence to back up such
a theory, but we can at least be certain that the word enta clearly con-
notes the idea of “over there”, “that yonder”, of something separated from
the speaker by physical distance. It may be noted that one Sindarin word
for “there”, namely ennas (SD:129 cf. 128), is understood to represent an
older locative form that could correspond to a Quenya word entass¨
e = “in
yonder [place]”. (Perhaps tana is simply a more general word for “that”,
merely focusing on the special identity of someone or something: “that one”
as opposed to any other.)
Yet another word for “that” is yana, mentioned in the entry ya in Etym:
After the gloss “that”, Tolkien added a parenthetical speciﬁcation: “(the
former)”. Perhaps aran yana would mean “that king” with the implication
that we are talking about a former king, now dead or at least no longer ruling.
There may be interesting contrasts between yana and enta as words for
“that”: In the Etymologies, Tolkien noted that the root ya signiﬁes “there,
over there; of time, ago”. He added that en, the root producing enta, “of
time points to the future”. So “that day” may translate as aur¨
e enta if
we are talking about some future day, not yet come, whereas aur¨
e yana is
“that day” with reference to some day in the past. (A “neutral” wording,
264


with no special implications, may be aur¨
e tana.)
As for plural demonstratives, like English “these” and “those”, we have no
attested Quenya forms. Yet the words sina “this” and tana, yana “that”
do look like adjectives by their form (-na being an adjectival or participial
ending), and enta “that yonder” Tolkien explicitly identiﬁed as an adjective
(Etym, entry en). So in all likelihood, we can inﬂect all of these words as
adjectives, and then we can derive their plural forms simply by changing the
ﬁnal -a to -¨
e:
vanda sina “this oath” / vandar sin¨
e “these oaths”
n´
ıs tana “that woman” / nissi tan¨
e “those women”
coa enta “that house [over there]” / coar ent¨
e “those houses”
aur¨
e yana “that day [in the past]” / auri yan¨
e “those days”
As in the case of normal adjectives with the ending -a, the plural forms
in -¨
e would represent archaic forms in -ai (vandar sinai etc.) Indirect ev-
idence conﬁrms that demonstratives could receive the plural ending -i in
older Elvish: In LotR, in the inscription on the Moria Gate, occurs the Sin-
darin phrase i thiw hin, translated “these runes”. Tolkien would have meant
this to represent something like in te˜
nwˆ
ai sinˆ
ai at an older stage – and in
Quenya, an old plural demonstrative sinˆ
ai “these” would ﬁrst become sinai
and then sin¨
e.
It is not clear whether the demonstratives discussed above could occur
by themselves, independently, and not only in conjunction with nouns. Can
we use sina for “this” in a sentence like “this is a good house”? (And if
we needed a plural form “these”, should we inﬂect sina as a noun when it
occurs by itself, so that the plural would now be sinar rather than sin¨
e?)
In PM:401, we have the sentence sin quent¨
e Quendingoldo. Tolkien pro-
vided no translation, but it must mean either “this Quendingoldo said” or
“thus spoke Quendingoldo”. The latter interpretation has it that sin is an
adverb “thus”, but if sin means “this”, it would be what we may call a
demonstrative pronoun – corresponding to sina, the latter however being
an adjective only occurring in conjunction with a noun. By this interpreta-
tion, it would be sin, rather than sina, we should use in sentences like “this
is a good house” or “I have seen this”. (And should the independent word
for “these” be something like sini, then?) As for the other demonstratives,
we have ta as an “independent” form of “that”, corresponding to the adjec-
tive tana (see Etym, entry ta). Of other such “independent” forms, little
or nothing is known, and in the exercises below, we will concentrate on the
adjectival demonstratives sina, tana, enta, yana used in conjunction with
nouns.
265


17.2
Inﬂecting the “Last Declinable Word”
Now that we have presented all the Quenya cases, we may also point out that
the various case endings are not always attached to the noun they logically
“belong” to. Where that noun is part of a longer phrase, like when the noun
is followed by an attributive adjective describing it, the case ending may be
added to the last word of the phrase.
Cirion’s Oath provides the classical example. It includes a reference to
Elendil Voronda, “Elendil the Faithful”, voronda being a Quenya ad-
jective meaning “steadfast, faithful”. Wrote Tolkien: “Adjectives used as a
‘title’ or frequently used attribute of a name are placed after the name.”
(UT:317; as we have pointed out earlier, Quenya here diﬀers from English
by not inserting a deﬁnite article between the name and the adjective –
hence not Elendil i Voronda, at least not necessarily).
In Cirion’s Oath, the name-and-title phrase Elendil Voronda is to ap-
pear in the genitive case: The Oath includes the words Elendil Vorondo
voronw¨
e, “Elendil the Faithful’s faith” – or (as it is translated in UT:305,
with an English-style word order) “the faith of Elendil the Faithful”. Notice
that the genitive ending -o, which we underlined, is added to the adjective
voronda (regularly displacing a ﬁnal -a) rather than to the noun Elendil.
In a way, the adjective following the noun is treated as an extension of
the noun proper, and so the case ending is added at the end of the whole
phrase. Tolkien commented on the construction Elendil Vorondo: “As is
usual in Quenya in the case of two declinable names in apposition only the
last is declined” (UT:317). Voronda “faithful” here stands in apposition to
“Elendil” as an additional “name” or title, and only the latter “name” is
declined (inﬂected for case).
This principle would work with all the various cases. The allative of
Elendil when the name occurs alone is attested as Elendilenna “to Elen-
dil” (PM:401), but “to Elendil the Faithful” would apparently be Elendil
Vorondanna, the last word of the phrase receiving the case ending.
Where a proper name followed by some epithet (like Voronda in this case)
is concerned, the system of adding any case endings to the last word of the
phrase may be more or less universal. Yet common nouns, not just proper
names, may also be qualiﬁed by adjectives following rather than preceding
the noun. Cf. for instance a phrase like mall¨
e t´
era “road straight” = “a
straight road” (LR:47). If we were to add the locative ending to express “on
a straight road”, to what word should it be attached? Should we apply the
“last declinable word” rule again (mall¨
e t´
erass¨
e) or attach the locative
ending to the noun (malless¨
e t´
era)?
It seems that both constructions would be permissible. The Markirya
poem provides a string of examples of noun-phrases where the noun proper
is followed by an adjective (in most cases a participle). Three consecutive ex-
amples involve the noun isilm¨
e “moonlight” combined with various partici-
266


ples (ilcala “gleaming”, p´
ıcala “waning”, lantala “falling”), and all three
noun phrases are inﬂected for the locative case by attaching the locative
ending to the last word of the phrase:
isilm¨
e ilcalass¨
e = “in gleaming moonlight”
isilm¨
e p´
ıcalass¨
e = “in waning moonlight”
isilm¨
e lantalass¨
e = “in falling moonlight”
(Tolkien’s more poetic translation in MC:215 goes “in the moon gleaming,
in the moon waning, in the moon falling”.)
Another phrase, again involving the participle ilcala “gleaming” but here
combined with the allative case, is particularly interesting:
axor ilcalannar = “upon gleaming bones”
Notice that the noun axo “bone” is here plural. The plural allative “upon
bones” occurring by itself would of course be axonnar. But here, where
the plural allative ending -nnar is attached to the last word of the phrase
instead, the noun axo itself receives only the simplest plural ending -r. Nor-
mally, axor would be taken as a nominative plural, but actually the -r merely
marks the word as a plural form in the simplest possible way: The actual
case marker follows later in the phrase. Words with nominative plurals in -i
would of course receive this plural marker instead, e.g. vendi lindalaiva =
“of singing maidens” (home-made example involving the possessive case, but
the principle would be the same for all the cases: dative vendi lindalain,
allative vendi lindalannar, etc.) We must assume that dual nouns would
also appear in their simplest (normally “nominative”) form at the beginning
of the phrase: The noun would merely assume the dual ending -u or -t, and
the full dual case ending would follow later in the phrase. To construct a
Tolkienesque example: Aldu caltalanta = “upon [the] shining couple of
trees”.
However, it is apparently not a hard-and-fast rule that you must attach
a case ending to the last word of the entire phrase rather than to the noun
proper. Markirya contains examples of phrases where an attributive adjec-
tive follows the noun it describes, and yet the case ending is added to the
noun, not the adjective. The ﬁrst example involves a plural instrumental
form (ending -inen), whereas the second example involves the locative case
(the ending -ss¨
e being added to a noun that is inﬂected for the somewhat
obscure “partitive plural” marked by the ending -li):
r´
amainen elvi¨
e = “on [/with] starlike wings”
ondoliss¨
e morn¨
e = “on dark rocks”
Of course, the adjectives elv¨
ea “starlike” and morna “dark” are here
plural (elvi¨
e, morn¨
e) to agree with the plural nouns they describe. It could
be that in both instances, the case ending is not added to the adjective be-
cause the adjectival plural inﬂection and the case inﬂection would somehow
267


collide. (In the phrase axor ilcalannar “upon gleaming bones” there is no
collision even though “bones” is plural, since participles in -la apparently do
not agree in number.) It is less than clear how an ending like -inen could be
added to a form like elvi¨
e anyway: ?elvi¨
einen seems like an unlikely and
awkward form, prone to collapse into the quite obscure word **elv´
ınen.
Perhaps that is why Tolkien preferred to add the case ending to the noun
r´
ama instead, even though this noun is not the last word of the phrase.
Yet the system of inﬂecting the “last declinable word” does seem to be
a common phenomenon in the language. It seems that sometimes, only the
last item on a list receives case endings that actually apply to all the nouns
that are listed. Namna Finw¨
e M´
ıriello is translated “the Statute of Finw¨
e
and M´
ıriel” (MR:258). Not only is the conjunction ar “and” that would have
separated the two names omitted, but the genitive ending -o “of” is added
to the last name (M´
ıriel, M´
ıriell-) only. The “full” construction would
presumably have been Namna Finw¨
eo ar M´
ıriello, but it was apparently
permissible to strip the phrase down to basics to provide the “Statute” with
a more concise title.
Though we have no attested examples, the demonstratives listed above
would seem to be good candidates for receiving case endings, if the word
order observed in the phrase vanda sina “oath this” is normal. For instance,
if we were to add the instrumental ending to express “by this oath”, it would
perhaps be best to say vanda sinanen. However, vandanen sina would
probably also be permissible – and in the plural (nominative presumably
vandar sin¨
e “these oaths”), consistently adding the case ending to the noun
would be the safest course: “By these oaths” would then be vandainen sin¨
e
rather than ?vandar sin¨
einen or sin´
ınen or whatever.
17.3
U-stem nouns
Apparently in the latter part of the “Common Eldarin” stage of Tolkien’s
simulated evolution of his Elvish languages, two parallel changes occurred,
aﬀecting what had earlier been short ﬁnal -i and short ﬁnal -u: they now
turned into -e and -o, respectively. However, since this change only occurred
where these vowels were ﬁnal, they remained -i- and -u- whenever some end-
ing or other element followed. We have already alluded to this phenomenon
earlier in this course; in particular, the student will remember it from the
variation observed in the aorist of primary verbs: sil¨
e “shines”, but pl. silir
“shine” (because original -i did not change to -e when there was a following
ending, like the plural marker -r in this example). Similar variation may
be observed in nouns and adjectives: We have already mentioned the noun
l´
om¨
e “night”, which has the stem-form l´
omi- (SD:415) because it descends
from earlier dˆ
omi- (see the entry domo in Etym). We must assume that
(say) the locative form “at night” would be l´
omiss¨
e. The adjective carn¨
e
268


“red” descends from primitive karani (see Etym, entry kar´
an) and there-
fore has the stem-form carni-, for instance in a compound like Carnistir
“Red-face” (PM:353).
The behaviour of these “i-stems” of course ﬁnds its parallel in the U-
stems, words that end in -o when this vowel is absolutely ﬁnal, but preserve
an original -u where some element follows this vowel. Such words seem to be
predominantly (perhaps exclusively) nouns. One example of a U-stem noun
is ango “snake”: Its stem-form angu- is directly observed in the compound
angul´
oc¨
e (simply glossed “dragon”, but actually combining the word for
“snake” with the word normally translated “dragon”, l´
oc¨
e: see the entry
lok in Etym). In the Etymologies, Tolkien derived ango “snake” from older
angu (or angwa, which would become angw and then angu), so the ﬁnal
-o of this word does indeed represent an older -u. Whenever the noun ango
is to receive endings for case or pronoun, it would apparently assume the
form angu-, e.g. dative angun “for a snake”, ablative angullo “from a
snake” or with a pronominal ending e.g. angulya “your snake”. The genitive
would presumably be anguo “of a snake”. (As we have demonstrated earlier,
“normal” nouns ending in -o do not have distinct genitive singular forms;
the genitive ending -o simply merges with the ﬁnal vowel.)
Where U-stem nouns end in either -go or -co, they assume a peculiar
form in the nominative plural. Normally, nouns ending in -o would of course
have nominative plural forms in -or. However, where -go and -co represent
older -gu and -ku, it seems that adding the primitive plural ending -ˆ
ı made
the preceding u become w, so that the plurals came to end in -gwˆ
ı or -
kwˆ
ı. Probably w merged with the g or k preceding it: The combinations
gw, kw are evidently best taken as unitary sounds, labialized versions of g
and k (that is, g or k pronounced with poised lips – look up Lesson One
again). In Quenya, these labialized sounds persisted, though by convention,
kw is spelt qu. Bottom line is, when we are told that ango “snake” has the
stem angu-, we can also deduce that the plural form is neither **angor
nor **angur, but angwi! The Etymologies conﬁrms this; the plural form
angwi is explicitly mentioned in the entry angwa/angu.
An example of a -qui plural is provided by the word urco “bogey”, which
has the plural urqui (= urcwi). Regarding this word, Tolkien noted that
“as the plural form shows”, urco must be derived from either urku or uruku
in the primitive language (WJ:390). Thus, urco is deﬁnitely a U-stem noun,
its ﬁnal -o representing older -u, and we would still see urcu- in compounds
and before most inﬂectional endings.
NOTE: The word urco “bogey” is akin to Sindarin orch, “Orc”. In WJ:390, Tolkien
notes that in the lore of the Blessed Realm, the word urco “naturally seldom occurs,
except in tales of the ancient days and the March [of the Eldar from Cuivi´
enen], and then
[it] is vague in meaning, referring to anything that caused fear to the Elves, any dubious
shape or shadow, or prowling creature. . . It might indeed be translated ‘bogey’.” Later,
when the Noldor returned to Middle-earth, the word urco pl. urqui was primarily used
269


with reference to Orcs, since the kinship (“though not precise equivalence”) of this Quenya
term to Sindarin orch was recognized. In Exilic Quenya, a Sindarin-inﬂuenced form also
appeared: Orco, the plural of which could be either orcor or orqui. The plural form orcor
occurs elsewhere as well (MR:74), but if one prefers orqui, one should probably let orco
“Orc” function as a U-stem in all respects. For instance, if one were to coin a compound
“Orc-language”, it should be orculamb¨
e rather than orcolamb¨
e. In the Etymologies, far
predating the source reproduced in WJ:390, Tolkien also gives the relevant word (glossed
“goblin!”) as orco pl. orqui: stem ´
orok. In Etym, there is no hint that this word was
borrowed into Quenya from another language; orco is referred to a primitive form ´
orku.
Tolkien’s precise ideas about the history of the Quenya word for “Orc” were apparently
subject to change, but the basic idea that nouns in -co derived from primitive forms in
-ku should have plurals in -qui rather than -cor is seen to persist. – In accordance with
our policy of avoiding speciﬁc references to Tolkien’s mythos in the exercises, we will not
refer to “Orcs” here, but we can use the word urco in its sense of “bogey” (it will occur
in the exercises appended to Lesson Eighteen).
We will try to survey the words involved (excluding the earliest “Qenya”
material). Ango “snake”, pl. angwi, seems to be our sole entirely certain
example of a -gwi plural. In the Etymologies, there was also lango “throat”,
pl. langwi (see the entry lank). The form langwi is for some reason marked
with an asterisk, which would normally indicate that this form is unattested,
but possibly it has another meaning here. Anyway, Tolkien decided to change
the word for “throat”, turning it into lanco instead. It is entirely possible
that this is also a U-stem, so that its plural should be lanqui rather than
lancor, though we have no explicit information to this eﬀect.
One certain U-stem is the word for “arm”, ranco (primitive form explic-
itly given as ranku). Just as we would expect, the plural form is ranqui;
see the entry rak in Etym. A word meaning “arm” would presumably often
appear in its dual form to signify a natural pair of arms. We may wonder
whether the dual form of ranco would be rancu (with the dual ending
-u, quite unrelated to the original ﬁnal -u that later became -o) or ran-
cut (i.e., the U-stem noun ranco, rancu- with the dual ending -t). As we
have argued from the attested example peu “pair of lips”, nouns denoting
body-parts occurring in pairs may consistently have “fossilized” dual forms
in -u, since it was this ending that originally denoted a natural or logical
pair. Once a pronominal ending is added, we may at least safely suﬃx -t to
indicate a dual form. Indeed, without this ending there would be no distinc-
tion between ranculya “your arm” and ranculyat “your (pair of) arms”,
no matter what the dual of ranco may be when the word occurs by itself:
Before endings, ranco must become rancu- anyway.
Another U-stem is rusco “fox”; it our source, Tolkien mentioned both the
stem-form ruscu- and the plural rusqui (VT41:10).
Not all U-stems end in -co or -go, of course. One example is the word curo
“a skillful device” (VT41:10, last word of gloss uncertain due to Tolkien’s
diﬃcult handwriting). Tolkien cited the stem-form curu-, and it apparently
270


also occurs in Saruman’s Quenya name: Curumo (UT:401). This name
seems to combine the element curu- with the masculine ending -mo “that
often appeared in names or titles” (WJ:400). We may wonder what the
nominative plural of curo, curu- would be. Could it be curwi, paralleling
angwi as the plural of ango, angu- “snake”?
Anyhow, the special nominative plurals ending in -wi (spelt -ui when
part of -qui) would also be reﬂected in the genitive plural and the dative
plural: If the nominative plural of rusco “fox” is rusqui (= ruscwi) the
corresponding dative and genitive forms can hardly be anything else than
rusquin (= ruscwin) and rusquion (= ruscwion), respectively. One would
think that we would also see rusquiva (= ruscwiva) as the plural posses-
sive, and rusquinen (= ruscwinen) as the plural instrumental. There is one
form that can be cited against the two latter assumptions: the related ad-
jective ruscuit¨
e “foxy”, mentioned in the same source that gives us rusco,
ruscu- pl. rusqui (VT41:10). In the word ruscuit¨
e, which includes the ad-
jectival ending -it¨
e, there is no development cui > cwi = qui; we don’t see
**rusquit¨
e. The ending -it¨
e may by its shape resemble the case endings
-iva and -inen for plural possessive and plural instrumental. So if we have
ruscuit¨
e, perhaps we would – as phonologically parallel forms – also see
ruscuiva and ruscuinen rather than rusquiva, rusquinen? We cannot
know. I will not construct any exercises involving the plural form of the
possessive and instrumental cases.
In the other cases, where the plural case endings do not include the vowel
-i, all one has to remember is to change the ﬁnal -o of a U-stem noun to -u
before adding whatever ending is relevant. Using ango, angu- “snake” as
our example, we would for instance have the plural allative angunnar “to
snakes” (not **angwinna or **angwinnar or whatever; cf. the singular an-
gunna “to a snake”). Likewise we would have the pl. ablative angullon or
angullor “from snakes” (sg. angullo “from a snake”), pl. locative angussen
“in snakes” (sg. anguss¨
e “in a snake”). As the corresponding dual forms,
we would presumably see angunta, angulto, anguts¨
e = “to/from/in a
pair of snakes”. Pronominal endings would also be added to the stem-form
angu-, and any further endings for number or case would then be added
after the pronominal ending as described in earlier lessons: angulya “your
snake”, plural angulyar (hardly **angwilyar!) “your snakes”, dual an-
gulyat “your pair of snakes”, dative angulyan “for your snake”, plural
dative angulyain (hardly **angwilyain!) “for your snakes”, etc. etc.
NOTE: Nonetheless, the nominative plurals in -wi (-gwi, -qui) must be seen as the most
striking feature of U-stem nouns. In at least one instance, this plural formation apparently
spread to another noun by analogy: According to the Etymologies, entry t´
elek, the noun
telco “leg” has the plural telqui, but this plural is said to be “analogical”. Presumably,
Tolkien’s idea is that telco is not a “true” u-stem noun (it does not come from Primitive
Elvish teleku or telku, but rather descends from something like telekˆ
o, telkˆ
o). Therefore, its
plural “should” have been telcor, and the actual form telqui is merely due to inﬂuence
271


from such pairs as ranco pl. ranqui or urco pl. urqui. However, telco seems to be
exceptional in this respect. I don’t think we should replace (say) Naucor as the plural
form of Nauco “Dwarf” with **Nauqui.
17.4
Ordinals
We have already introduced three ordinal numbers, minya “ﬁrst”, (t)atya
“second” and nelya “third”. All three include the frequent adjectival ending
-ya (occurring in the word Quenya “Elvish” itself). However, it turns out
that most ordinals end in -¨
ea, displacing the ﬁnal vowel of the correspond-
ing cardinal number. Thus we have the following correspondences between
cardinals and ordinals:
canta “four” vs. cant¨
ea “fourth”
lemp¨
e “ﬁve” vs. lemp¨
ea “ﬁfth”
enqu¨
e “six” vs. enqu¨
ea “sixth”
otso “seven” vs. ots¨
ea “seventh”
tolto “eight” vs. tolt¨
ea “eighth” (also told¨
ea, presupposing toldo as a variant
word for “8”)
nert¨
e “nine” vs. nert¨
ea “ninth”
This table is based on an account of Eldarin numerals written by Tolkien in
the late sixties, published in VT42:24–27 (also see the editorial notes on pp.
30–31). Tolkien indicated that the word for “ﬁfth” had earlier been either
lemenya or lepenya (with the same ending as in minya etc.), but this
“irregular” form was later replaced by lemp¨
ea by analogy with the simple
cardinal lemp¨
e “ﬁve”. Tolkien’s notes present varying views as to when this
substitution occurred (whether already in pre-Exilic times, or later), but it
is at least clear that in Frodo’s day, lemp¨
ea would be the word to use when
you need to express “ﬁfth”.
Even the words for “second” and “third” could have the ending -¨
ea in-
stead of -ya. The ordinal (t)atya “second” was “early replaced” by att¨
ea,
which would be a “regular” formation compared to the cardinal atta “two”.
Similarly, nelya as the word for “three” could also be replaced by neld¨
ea,
more clearly reﬂecting the cardinal neld¨
e “three” (but in this case, nothing
is said about neld¨
ea wholly replacing nelya).
VT42:25 also lists a word for “tenth”, quain¨
ea, but this presupposes
another word for “ten” than the form cainen mentioned in the Etymologies.
A root kay- having to do with the number “ten” seems to have haunted
Tolkien’s imagination for at least thirty years, so I hesitate to throw it over
board just because a divergent form turns up in one late manuscript – but
this is not the place to discuss what forms we should accept as “valid” or
“canonical”. The ordinal corresponding to the cardinal cainen could be
either cainenya or cain¨
ea (but hardly ?cainen¨
ea).
272


Over the next three lessons, we will work our way through the attested
ordinals, starting with the word for “fourth” (cant¨
ea).
Summary of Lesson Seventeen
Quenya demonstratives include sina “this”, tana “that” (one early source
also has tanya), enta “that (yonder)” (apparently with emphasis on spatial
position, though it may also refer to something that lies in the future) and
yana “that (former)” (of time used of something that lies in the past, the
opposite of enta). It may be assumed that the corresponding plural forms
(the words for “these” and “those”) end in -¨
e rather than -a, since these
demonstratives probably behave like adjectives. Demonstratives are, or may
be, placed after the noun they connect with; Cirion’s Oath has vanda sina
for “this oath” (we cannot know whether the English-style word order sina
vanda would be equally valid, and the word order observed in Cirion’s Oath
is consistently employed in the exercises below). – Where there are several
declinable words in a phrase, as when a noun is followed by an attributive
adjective (or participle) describing it, a case ending may be added to the
last word of the phrase. The noun itself, if not singular, would receive only
the simplest endings for number (the endings normally associated with the
nominative case, like -i or -r in the plural): The case ending that follows later
in the phrase would still determine what case the entire phrase is. – U-stem
nouns originally ended in the vowel -u, which in Quenya has become -o when
the word occurs without endings, but where not ﬁnal, the vowel remains -
u-. Thus a word like ango “snake” appears as angu- in a compound (e.g.
angul´
oc¨
e “snake-dragon”), and no doubt also before endings for pronoun
or case (e.g. angulya “your snake”, or allative angunna “to a snake”).
The nominative plural of U-stem nouns is formed with the ending -i (rather
than -r), and at least where the noun happens to end in -go or -co, the
ﬁnal vowel representing an older u turns into w before the plural ending.
Thus the nominative plural of ango, angu- is angwi, and the plural of
ranco, rancu- is ranqui (this spelling representing rancwi). These special
plurals may also be reﬂected in the other cases that have plural case endings
involving the vowel i, certainly the genitive plural (angwion, ranquion)
and dative plural (angwin, ranquin). – The ordinal numbers from “fourth”
to “ninth” are formed by replacing the ﬁnal vowel of the corresponding
cardinal number with -¨
ea, e.g. cant¨
ea “fourth” from canta “four”. Even
the ordinals (t)atya “second” and nelya “third” may be replaced by att¨
ea,
neld¨
ea (cf. the cardinals atta “two”, neld¨
e “three”).
273


Vocabulary
In addition to learning these new words, the student should notice that the
noun ranco “arm” (introduced in Lesson Three) is a U-stem: rancu-.
cant¨
ea “fourth”
tana demonstrative “that”
enta demonstrative “that [yonder]”, “[the one] over there” (of time referring
to some future entity)
yana demonstrative “that” = “the former” (of time referring to some past entity)
sina demonstrative “this”
ango (angu-) “snake”
sangwa “poison”
l´
om¨
e (l´
omi-) “night”
polda adjective “strong, burly” (of physical strength only; the verb pol- “can” is
probably related)
halla adjective “tall”
forya adjective “right”
Formen “(the) North” (cf. Formenos, the “Northern Fortress” constructed by
F¨
eanor in the Blessed Realm; the ﬁnal element -os is reduced from osto “fortress;
city”.)
This concludes our listing of the four directions N´
umen, Hyarmen, R´
omen, For-
men = West, South, East, North (this being their proper “Middle-earth” order). Just
as Hyarmen “South” is related to the adjective hyarya “left”, so Formen “North” is
related to the adjective forya “right”, since the reference-point is that of a person facing
West (looking towards Valinor).

Lesson 18
Independent pronouns. Impersonal verbs. U-stem verbs.
The various uses of l´
a.
18.1
Independent pronouns
(inevitably entailing a discussion of certain
Second Person obscurities)
All the pronouns so far discussed have been endings. However, Quenya also
has pronouns that appear as independent words. Some of them are em-
phatic; the pronoun appears as a separate word to put special emphasis on
it. These emphatic pronouns we will discuss in the next lesson. Here we will
concentrate on the simplest independent pronominal elements.
We have already cited Quenya sentences including the dative pronoun
nin “for me”. The dative ending -n is here appended to an independent
word for “I”, ni, attested by itself in the “Arctic” sentence mentioned in
The Father Christmas Letters. (Though this posthumously published work
of Tolkien’s has nothing to do with the Arda mythos, the “Arctic” sentence
is transparently a form of Quenya.) The relevant part of the sentence goes
ni v´
ela tye, “I see you”. The verb “see” is here apparently vel- rather than
cen- (perhaps vel- is “see” in the sense of “meet”?), but more remarkable
is the fact that for the subject “I”, the independent pronoun ni is used
instead of the ending -n or -ny¨
e. There seems to be no obvious “reason” for
this deviation from the normal system. It has been suggested that since the
intended audience for The Father Christmas Letters was Tolkien’s young
children, he may have “simpliﬁed” the language to make it easier for them
to ﬁgure out which word means what. However, since the latter part of the
“Arctic” sentence employs a quite complex grammatical construction which
is certainly not the literal counterpart of the English translation provided,
we should hardly think of the language as “simpliﬁed”. For “I” as subject,
the ending -n(y¨
e) added to the verb is normally to be preferred, but the
independent word ni may be a valid alternative. It may be noted that in
one of Tolkien’s draft versions for Elendil’s Declaration, the word that ended
276


up as maruvan “I will remain/dwell” appears as nimaruva, Tolkien using
ni- “I” as a preﬁx: SD:56. (It may be, however, that the idea of subject
preﬁxes was dropped; no post-LotR evidence of such preﬁxes has ever been
published. If I were to use the independent pronoun ni instead of the ending
-n, I would let it stand as a separate word: Ni maruva.)
Besides ni, we have a handful of other independent pronouns attested.
One such pronoun is ta, meaning “it” or “that” (see Etym, entry ta – the
demonstrative tana “that” is of course related). One relatively early source
suggests that it can receive case endings. The ten-word Koivien´
eni sen-
tence published in Vinyar Tengwar #27 is not LotR-style Quenya in its en-
tirety, but the short phrase Orome tanna lende (translated “Orome came
thither”) may well have remained a valid wording after “Qenya” evolved
into Quenya as we know it from later sources. The word tanna “thither”
seems to be ta “that, it” with the regular allative ending -nna attached,
hence “to that [place]” = “thither”.
In Nam´
ari¨
e, one independent pronoun occurs in the phrase imb¨
e met =
“between us”. This is a dual pronoun, referring to Galadriel and Varda, so
met appropriately receives the dual ending -t (also known from nouns) to
indicate that two persons are concerned. Removing the dual ending leaves
us with me, probably covering both “we” (subject form) and “us” (object
form). In our example, this is an exclusive “we/us”, corresponding to the
ending -mm¨
e, which is obviously closely related. The party addressed is not
included (Galadriel was singing to Frodo about herself and Varda). Me is
also attested in its dative form, with the dative ending -n attached: men =
“for us, to us”.
The ending -ly¨
e “you” corresponds to an independent pronoun le, which
was apparently present already in early forms of Elvish (WJ:363). In Sin-
darin it had been lost, but it is precisely this circumstance which allows us
to say with certainty that it survived in Quenya: In his notes on the Sin-
darin hymn A Elbereth Gilthoniel, Tolkien stated that the reverential 2nd
person pronoun le occurring in this Grey-elven text had been borrowed from
Quenya (RGEO:73).
At Cormallen, the crowds hailed Frodo and Sam with the words a laita
te, laita te, translated in Letters:308 as “bless them, bless them”. Thus we
have te as an independent object pronoun “them”. (For this meaning, the
Cormallen Praise also provides us with the already-discussed ending -t, as
in laituvalmet = “we shall bless them”. Presumably the pronoun te and
the ending -t are related.) Whether this te can also be used as a subject
form (“they”) is unfortunately unclear.
This te is possibly related to the word ta “that, it” discussed above: It
may well be that ta early received the plural ending -i, the resulting form
tai being as it were the plural form of “that” – hence meaning something
like “those [ones]” or indeed “them”. By this theory, the attested form te is
simply the unstressed variant of tai (cf. adjectives in -a having plural forms
277


in -¨
e, simpliﬁed from older -ai). A direct attestation of a form tai eventually
turned up in VT42:34, and the context allows the interpretation that it may
literally mean “those”; see below. Interestingly, the dative form “for them,
to them” is apparently attested as tien. This could very well represent older
taien, which would be tai “those” + the connecting vowel -e- + the dative
ending -n. In this position, the diphthong ai is reduced to e, and as taien
consequently morphs into te’en = t¨
een, this rather unstable form becomes
tien by exactly the same mechanism that also turns (laureai >) laur¨
ee into
lauri¨
e (the plural form of the adjective laur¨
ea “golden”). We may assume
that the allative “to(wards) them” would likewise be tienna, whereas the
ablative “from them” would be tiello. These forms would coincide with the
corresponding case forms of the noun ti¨
e “path”, but in context, one should
normally be able to ﬁgure out what the intended meaning is.
Another attested object pronoun is tye, translated “thee” or “you”. We
have already quoted the phrase ni v´
ela tye “I see you” from the “Arc-
tic” sentence. Other attestations come from a source that is more deﬁnitely
Quenya or at least “Qenya”: In LR:61, Herendil addresses his father Elendil
with the words atarinya tye-mel´
an¨
e, “my father, I love thee”, and Elendil
answers, a yonya iny¨
e tye-m´
ela, “and I too, my son, I love thee”. There
are a few strange things here (like -n¨
e rather than -ny¨
e or -n being used
as the pronominal ending “I” in the ﬁrst sentence), but it is at least clear
that tye is the object pronoun “thee”, and this is probably a valid form in
LotR-style Quenya as well.
At this point it should be noted that Quenya has (at least) two sets of
pronouns in the second person. The object pronoun tye is not “compatible”
with the ending -l(y¨
e) or the corresponding independent pronoun le, though
all of these may be translated “you” in English. We must distinguish be-
tween the “L” forms, represented by the ending -l(y¨
e) and the independent
pronoun le, and the “T” forms, represented by the object pronoun tye and
also by the verb ending -t exempliﬁed in WJ:364 (more about the latter in
the next lesson; it is not to be confused with -t = “them” as in laituvalmet
= “we will bless them”). All of these pronouns and endings have to do with
the idea of “you, thou, thee”, but Tolkien seems to have been changing his
mind back and forth as to what the basic distinction between the T-forms
and the L-forms really consists of. Back in Lesson Eight, we quoted a pas-
sage that was originally meant to go into the LotR appendices, but which
was not in the event included there: Tolkien stated that “all these languages
. . . had, or originally had, no distinction between the singular and plural of
the second person pronouns; but they had a marked distinction between the
familiar forms and the courteous” (PM:42–43).
Within this scheme, the “L” forms would represent a polite and cour-
teous “you”, whereas the “T” forms signal a familiar/intimate “you” used
to address close friends and family members. This would agree well with
the evidence: In Nam´
ari¨
e, Galadriel naturally uses “L” forms when politely
278


addressing a relative stranger like Frodo, and in Sindarin, the Quenya bor-
rowing le is used as a reverential singular “thee” (as in the hymn A Elbereth
Gilthoniel, where Varda is the party addressed). On the other hand, Herendil
would obviously use a “T” form (tye) when addressing his own father. When
Tolkien translated tye in the latter example as “thee” rather than “you”,
he probably meant it to be an intimate rather than an overly solemn form
(though confusingly, he might also use “thou/thee” to represent a formal or
polite “you”; indeed this is how he rendered the “L” forms of both Nam´
ari¨
e
and A Elbereth Gilthoniel).
What does not agree so well with this reconstruction is the fact that in
WJ:364, Tolkien seems to imply that the “L” forms represent a plural “you”,
whereas the “T” forms stand for a singular “you” – sharply contrasting with
his earlier statement to the eﬀect that Elvish (just like English) fails to dis-
tinguish between sg. and pl. “you”. Moreover, “L” forms are unquestionably
used in a singular sense in Nam´
ari¨
e, since Tolkien translated them using the
distinctly singular English pronoun “thou”. I think the only solution that
comes close to incorporating all the material would be to assume that the
“T” forms properly denote singular “you” whereas the “L” forms properly
denote plural “you” – but the latter forms are also used as a polite singular
“you” (so in Nam´
ari¨
e). Bottom line is, one should not use the object form
tye for “you, thee” if one otherwise uses “L” forms like the ending -ly¨
e or
the pronoun le: We are apparently dealing with two diﬀerent kinds of “you”
here, and the “T” forms are hardly interchangeable with the “L” forms.
Based on the object pronoun tye “you = thee” (not subject “thou”), some
writers have ventured to extrapolate a First Person object form nye “me”
(cf. ni “I”). Apparently the form nye actually appears in Tolkien’s papers,
so we will adopt this nye = “me” here. It should be noted, however, that
any case endings are added to the simplest form of the pronoun, that is,
what functions as the subject form when it occurs by itself – in this case
ni “I”. Case endings are not added the object form nye “me”: The dative
form “to me” is not **nyen, despite the English translation. As we know,
the actual form is nin (ni-n = “I-for”). “For you/for thee” should likewise
not be **tyen, for then we would be adding case endings to the object form
again. Unfortunately, it is not clear what the subject form corresponding to
tye “thee” really is, so the long-suﬀering student must forgive yet another
batch of Second Person Obscurities: Mechanical extrapolation based on the
attested ni/nye pair would of course land us on ?ti as the subject form
“thou”. However, the story is almost certainly more complicated than this.
The Sindarin pronominal ending for “you” is said to be -g or -ch, indicating
that these endings appeared as -k-, -kk- in earlier Elvish. In Quenya, a
ﬁnal -k would turn into -t (cf. for instance ﬁlic- as the stem-form of a noun
meaning “small bird”, closely reﬂecting the root philik; but when this noun
appears without any endings, its Quenya form turns into ﬁlit). If the above-
mentioned ending -t “thou” likewise comes from an original -k, we must
279


also assume that the object pronoun tye represents earlier kye (initial ky-
regularly turns into ty- in Quenya, cf. for instance the entry kyel in Etym,
from which root Tolkien derived the verb tyel- “end, cease”). It is, then, this
kye we must start from when trying to extrapolate the corresponding subject
form. Its Quenya form would likely be ci (ki) or perhaps rather ce (ke): In
the pronouns, the vowel i may seem to be peculiar to the 1st person (ni “I”),
whereas e is more frequent (le “you”, me “we” etc.) Thus, the dative form
“for you, for thee” may be something like ?cen, and likewise in the other
cases, e.g. ablative cello “from thee”. If this is correct, what we have called
the “T” forms must rather be termed the “C/T” forms, since the original k
may be preserved in some Quenya forms as well (spelt c). But of course, we
have now crossed over into the realm of Speculative Extrapolation. In the
exercises below, only the attested object form tye appears.
To summarize, we have ni “I” (object form nye “me”), le “you” (plural
or polite singular; the object form is likely also le), tye object form “thee,
you” (intimate; the subject form that could also receive case endings is
unfortunately uncertain, perhaps ?ce or ?ci), me “we” (exclusive; probably
this can also be used as the object form “us”), te object form “them” (the
subject form “they” is uncertain, but perhaps identical; in any case, it may
be that this pronoun appears as tai when stressed, and before at least some
case endings it assumes the form tie-). This does not add up to a complete
pronoun table; I hope to discuss what little can be inferred about the gaps
in an appendix to this course.
As for the functions of these pronouns, the examples cited above will
already have provided the student with vital clues. These words (except the
distinct object forms) can receive case endings; the dative form nin “for me,
to me” is particularly well attested. Presumably we can also have allative
ninna “to(wards) me”, allative nillo “from me”, locative niss¨
e “in me” and
perhaps even instrumental ninen “by me”. It should be noted that pronouns
normally receive “singular” case endings, even if the pronoun is “plural” by
its meaning; thus me “we” takes the singular dative ending -n, not plural -in
even though the word me is “plural” insofar as “we” must refer to several
people. The dual ending -t can however be added to independent pronouns,
as indicated by the example met “[the two of] us” in Nam´
ari¨
e. Then any
case endings would presumably also be dual: dative ment, allative menta,
ablative melto, instrumental menten. (Another plausible dual form could
be ?let = “you two”.)
Another function of the independent pronouns would be to appear follow-
ing prepositions, as in the example imb¨
e met “between us [two]” in Na-
mari¨
e. In English, prepositions are followed by the object form (accusative
case), hence for instance “as me” rather than “as I”. If this applies to Quenya
as well, the equivalent would be ve nye, but we cannot be certain; perhaps
the Eldar would actually say ve ni = “as I”. The attested example imb¨
e
met “between us [two]” is of no help in this matter, since me (with or
280


without the dual ending -t) likely covers both the subject form “we” and
the object form “us”. At least we can’t go wrong as long as we are dealing
with me and le (and te?), since these pronouns don’t seem to have distinct
subject/object forms.
The function of the object forms (the attested words nye “me”, tye
“you/thee”, te “them” + the probable non-distinct forms me “us” and
le “you” just discussed) would obviously be to appear as the object of a
sentence. After all, pronominal objects can’t always be expressed as one of
the two attested object endings -t “them” or -s “it” (though the full list
of object endings is likely somewhat longer). These object endings may be
added to extended inﬁnitives in -ta (caritas “to do it”) or to verbs that also
has a subject ending (ut´
uvienyes “I have found it”), but this grammatical
environment is not always present. The independent object pronouns may
for instance be used in imperative phrases, as in the attested example a
laita te “bless them” already cited. Presumably such pronouns can also be
used following gerunds inﬂected for dative (e.g. ut´
ulien cenien tye “I have
come [in order] to see you”). We may also have to use independent object
pronouns where the verb has no subject pronominal ending to which an ob-
ject pronominal ending can be added – because the subject is expressed as a
separate word. So while “we will bless them” can be packed into one word as
laituvalmet, a sentence like “the people will bless them” must perhaps be
i li¨
e laituva te with a separate word for “them”. (We can’t know whether
it is permissible to say ?i li¨
e laituvat with the ending -t added to the verb
even though it has no subject ending; using a separate word for “them” is
therefore safer as well as clearer.)
The preferred word order is somewhat uncertain. Quenya may seem to
prefer placing independent pronouns in front of the verb. Sometimes Tolkien
even preﬁxed the object pronoun to the verb by means of a hyphen, as in the
example tye-mel´
an¨
e “I love thee” cited above. (Compare French je t’aime,
literally “I you love” with the object preceding the verb instead of following
it – though French, as well as Quenya, normally has the object following the
verb.) So perhaps sentences like “I have come to see thee” or “the people
will bless them” should rather be ut´
ulien tye-cenien and i li¨
e te-laituva,
respectively? Sometimes, Tolkien even placed dative pronouns in front of
the verb, as in the question occurring in the middle of Nam´
ari¨
e: S´
ı man i
yulma nin enquantuva? = “Now who will reﬁll the cup for me?” (notice
how the Quenya word-order diﬀers from that of the English translation).
We even have one extreme example, involving the verb lumna- “lie heavy”,
where a dative pronoun is not only preﬁxed to the verb but the dative
ending -n is assimilated to the initial l- of the verb itself: Mel-lumna is
translated “us-is-heavy” (LR:47), sc. “is heavy for us”; this must be the
dative form men “for us, to us” + the aorist form lumna “lies heavy”.
The underlying, unattested form men-lumna apparently had to be altered
because men completely glued itself to the following word and came to be
281


perceived as part of it – and then there was suddenly a de facto cluster nl
which Quenya phonology did not permit, so it had to become l-l instead.
Yet such extra complications are apparently avoidable, for other examples
indicate that independent pronouns may also follow the verb. In VT41:13 we
have the sentence ´
orenya qu´
eta nin = “my heart is saying to me” (variant
´
orenya quet¨
e nin, page 11). Presumably ´
orenya nin qu´
eta (or even
. . . nin-qu´
eta) would have been equally possible, but it is apparently not
“necessary” to employ such a word order, or indeed to preﬁx object/dative
pronouns directly to the verb.
As for the “subject forms” discussed above, they may of course appear as
the subject of a sentence, like ni “I” in ni v´
ela tye “I see you”. Nonetheless,
here Quenya would more frequently use pronominal endings (like v´
elan
or v´
elany¨
e in this case – assuming that the verb ?vel- “see” is valid in
LotR-style Quenya!) For poets trying to maintain some meter it may be
useful to be able to choose between independent pronouns and pronominal
endings. However, the “subject forms” discussed above would most often be
encountered, not as grammatical subjects, but with case endings attached!
Even so, it is probable that pronouns like ni or le would frequently function
as the subject of sentences when the copula “is/are/am” is left out and
understood: Ni aran “I [am] king”, le halla “you [are] tall”, etc.
18.2
Impersonal verbs
Having investigated independent dative forms like nin “for me, to me”, we
can fully understand our very few attested examples of sentences involving
so-called impersonal verbs. In UT:396, Tolkien cites a verb ´
ola- “to dream”,
adding a brief remark to the eﬀect that this verb is “impersonal”. Precisely
what he meant by this was long obscure, but now we have at least one
example that may be helpful in this regard.
The sentences in question involves the primary verb or- “urge, impel,
move” (elsewhere also given as an A-stem ora-). The regular aorist or¨
e
“urges, impels, moves” occurs in the sentence or¨
e nin caritas, translated
“I would like to do so” or “I feel moved to do so”. Literally it means “[it]
impels for me to do it”. Notice that this sentence has no subject (though
in our attempted literal translation, we had to ﬁll in the dummy-subject
“it” to achieve something like passable English – “it” has no real meaning
here!) Quenya by its very grammatical construction indicates that the “urge”
perceived by the speaker impacts on him from the outside, so to speak.
Feeling moved to do something is not a deliberate “act” carried out by a
subject; this feeling rather aﬀects the person involved, and in Quenya this is
appropriately denoted by the dative case. In our attested example, a dative
pronoun is involved, but we must assume that it could just as well be a
regular noun: Or¨
e i Eldan lelya = “[it] impels for the Elf to go” = “the
282


Elf feels moved to go”. The verb is the ﬁrst word of the sentence; normally
the subject would come ﬁrst, but here there simply isn’t any subject.
As for the impersonal verb ´
ola- “to dream”, we must assume that the
underlying idea is the same: Dreaming is not an “act” done by a subject,
rather it is something that happens to you; your dreams come to you quite
independent of your own will, and therefore the dreamer is best presented
as a person aﬀected by his or her dreams: Hence dative for the dreamer!
Tolkien gave us no examples involving ´
ola-, but “the maiden dreams about
Elves” could perhaps be rendered something like ´
ola i venden Eldaron
(notice that vend¨
e “maiden” here appears as a dative form, indicating that
“the maiden” is perceived as the receiver of the dreams rather than as their
maker – cf. the use of the dative to denote the recipient in connection with
the verb “to give”).
Such constructions, even in connection with the verb “to dream”, are not
unheard of in the languages of our own world. As David Kiltz wrote on the
Elﬂing list (April 25, 2001): “The dative has many more functions than just
that of an indirect object. It can . . . denote the ‘subjective experiencer’ as
in . . . German mir ist kalt ‘I’m cold’ where you [would] use a nominative
for the logical subject in English but not in many other languages.” Mir ist
kalt means “to-me [it] is cold”; the German dative form mir corresponds to
Quenya nin. Given that the Quenya word for “cold” is ringa, it is entirely
possible that mir ist kalt can be rendered directly into Quenya as nin n´
a
ringa (or perhaps rather n´
a ringa nin “[it] is cold for me”).
We don’t know very many Quenya verbs that invite such constructions,
though. In the entry mbaw- in the Etymologies, Tolkien mentioned that the
“Noldorin” verb bui “compel” is impersonal (“Noldorin” being the concep-
tual predecessor of the Sindarin language exempliﬁed in LotR). The Quenya
verb corresponding to “Noldorin” bui is given as mauya-. If this can also
function as an impersonal verb (though it can probably occur with an ex-
plicit subject as well), we may have a clue as to how “I must” or “I need
to” would be expressed in Quenya. Perhaps “I must go” would (or at least
could) be expressed as mauya nin lelya = “[it] compels for me to go”.
In some cases, it may not even be necessary to complement an impersonal
verb with a dative noun or pronoun. Regarding a “Noldorin” form of the
verb corresponding to Quenya ulya- “pour”, namely oeil or eil, Tolkien
noted that it was used for “it is raining” (Etym, entry ulu). Again, English
by grammatical necessity ﬁlls in a dummy-subject “it”, but here there is
obviously no real subject which actually “does” rain. Perhaps Quenya ulya,
or continuative uly¨
ea, can likewise be used for “[it] is raining”: The naked
verb would be a full sentence in itself.
283


18.3
U-stem verbs
This is an obscure sub-group of verbs; having discussed U-stem nouns in
the previous lesson, we may explore U-stem verbs now. Our data being very
limited, this discussion must by necessity consist mainly of speculation.
Verbal stems with the ending -u are not uncommon in Tolkien’s early
“Qenya” material, but as the decades went by, he may seem to have cut
down their number. Of the well over 1,200 Quenya words mentioned in the
Etymologies, there is only one single U-stem verb, namely palu- “open wide,
spread, expand, extend” (and even this verb has an alternative form palya-
with the much more common verbal ending -ya: see the entry pal). Around
1960, in his essay Quendi and Eldar, Tolkien mentioned the verb nicu- “be
chill, cold” with reference to weather (WJ:417). Some years later, he also
used a few U-stem verbs in the latest version of the Markirya poem: ﬁf´
ıru-
“slowly fade away” (elaboration of the simpler verb ﬁr- “die, fade”), hlapu-
“ﬂy or stream in the wind”, nurru- “murmur, grumble” (MC:223).
How are these verbs to be inﬂected? Markirya as printed in MC:222 in-
dicates that the active participle of hlapu- is hl´
apula, indicating that the
active participle is formed by adding the normal ending -la and lengthen-
ing the main vowel if possible (hlapu- becoming hl´
apu-). The participle
of nurru- “murmur” is attested as nurrula; here the vowel could not be
lengthened because of the following consonant cluster (**n´
urrula being
an impossible Quenya word). The formation of the active participle is just
about the only thing we can be quite sure about regarding this class of verbs
(and therefore also the only thing I touch on in the Translate-into-Quenya
exercises below).
The passive participle is problematic. The normal ending -na or its longer
variant -ina would presumably be applied somehow. Some have argued that
we may have an attested example of the passive participle of a U-stem verb.
We have earlier referred to the mysterious form tur´
un’ (obviously shortened
from tur´
una) in Nienor’s cry: A T´
urin Turambar tur´
un’ ambartanen,
“[o T´
urin] master of doom by doom mastered” (UT:138). A primary verb
tur- “wield, control, govern” does occur in Tolkien’s material, but we would
expect its passive participle to be turna (cf. carna “made” as the attested
passive participle of car- “make, do”). Could the strange form tur´
una “mas-
tered” actually be the passive participle of a variant U-stem verb turu- “to
master”? However, is not clear why adding the ending -na to turu- would
produce tur´
una with a long vowel – and other indirect evidence points in
another direction. As has been pointed out by some, the ending -(i)na that
is used to derive passive participles also turns up in other parts of speech,
and we have at least one example demonstrating what happens when it is
added to a noun stem in -u: The adjective culuina “orange” is derived from
a root kul, kulu “gold”. Here a diphthong ui arises when the ﬁnal -u of
the stem is combined with the ending -ina. Carrying this principle over to
284


U-stem verbs, we could argue that the passive participle of palu- “expand”
should be ?paluina “expanded”. Analogy with A-stem verbs would point
in the same direction (cf. hastaina “marred” as the attested participle of
hasta- “to mar”) – but lacking attested examples, we cannot be sure.
The inﬁnitive is quite problematic. It ought to be a stem with no additions.
In the previous lesson we pointed out that U-stem nouns originally ended
in a short -u. This original vowel is preserved unchanged whenever some
ending follows, but in Quenya it had turned into -o when it was absolutely
ﬁnal. Applying the same principle to U-stem verbs, the inﬁnitive of palu-
“expand” could conceivably be ?palo. Of course, we would still see palu-
before endings, for instance if this class of verbs may also have extended
forms in -ta: hence ?paluta, or with an object ending ?palutas, “to expand
it”.
The aorist is little less obscure. As we remember, primary verbs assume
the ending -i, preserved as such before further endings, but turning into -¨
e
when ﬁnal (sil¨
e “shines”, but pl. silir “shine”). Since the phonological shift
that makes an original ﬁnal short -i become -¨
e closely parallels the shift
that turns an original ﬁnal short -u into -o, we could plausibly argue that
palu- “expand” ought to have the aorist ?palo “expands” (identical to the
inﬁnitive), preserved as ?palu- before any ending (e.g. palur “expand” with
a plural subject, palun or paluny¨
e “I expand”, palus “he/she/it expands”,
etc. etc.) However, one piece of evidence diverges from this scenario: After
mentioning the U-stem verb nicu- “be chill, cold”, Tolkien also cited the
form niqu¨
e, which he translated “it is cold, it freezes” (WJ:417). Is this verb
niqu¨
e to be understood as the aorist form of nicu-? Are we to understand
that just as in the case of primary verbs, the ending -i was added to the
U-stem as well, and that a development nicui > nicwi ensued? After the
change of ﬁnal short -i to -¨
e, this would indeed produce the attested form
(nicwe =) niqu¨
e. If so, the aorist of palu- could be ?palw¨
e, or with endings
?palwi-. However, we may wonder why U-stem verbs take the aorist ending
-i when A-stems do not. This would not be encouraging for our nice little
theory that the ending -i is applied to primary verbs merely as a kind of
stop-gap to make up for the lack of any other ending (for U-stem verbs
obviously do have another ending – the -u itself!) Indeed it was the form
niqu¨
e I was thinking of when I warned the student back in Lesson Seven,
“This ‘simpliﬁed’ view is not wholly unproblematic, but it works most of
the time.” We have now reached the point where it may not work anymore.
While the aorist of palu- may plausibly be assumed to be ?palw¨
e or
with endings ?palwi-, perfectly paralleling (nicwe =) niqu¨
e as the aorist of
nicu-, we can only wonder how verbs like hlapu- or nurru- would behave
if they received the ending -i already in the primitive language. They could
hardly evolve into **nurrw¨
e or **hlapw¨
e, which would be quite impossible
Quenya words. Perhaps the original diphthong ui would be preserved in all
positions, and we would see ?nurrui and ?hlapui with no change of -i to
285


-¨
e even where the vowel is absolutely ﬁnal? However, I hardly have to tell
the student that we have now entered the realm of Extreme Speculation.
The present tense must also be speculative, but Tolkien provided one
excellent clue. It should be remembered that the present tense (e.g. s´
ıla “is
shining”) actually represents a kind of “continuous” or “continuative” verbal
stem, derived by lengthening the stem-vowel (if possible) and adding the
ending -a. In the very last version of the Markirya poem, Tolkien replaced
one of the participles with what would seem to be a continuative stem:
As is evident from Christopher Tolkien’s annotation in MC:222, his father
altered nurrula “mumbling, murmuring” to nurrua. Here, the continuative
stem in eﬀect functions as a participle (still meaning “mumbling”), and the
revision actually seems quite pointless, but at least Tolkien gave away that
the ending -a may be added to a U-stem verb. In another context, nurrua
could presumably have functioned as the present tense “is murmuring”. In
this case, the stem-vowel could not be lengthened because of the following
consonant cluster, but the present tense of a verb like palu- “to expand”
would in all likelihood be p´
alua “is expanding”.
In the past tense we can be reasonably certain that the regular past tense
ending -n¨
e would be added. At least this was the case in Tolkien’s earliest
“Qenya”: The Qenya Lexicon of 1915 lists allun¨
e as the past tense of the
verb allu- “wash” (QL:30). I use this system in the exercises below (but
only in the Translate-from-Quenya section, so at least I won’t seduce my
students into constructing uncertain Quenya verb forms themselves!)
The perfect tense is obscure. The augment (the preﬁxed stem-vowel) would
presumably be preﬁxed as usual, while the vowel would – if possible – be
lengthened in its normal position. So the perfect tenses of palu-, nurru-
would presumably commence as ap´
al-, unurr-. But what comes next is any-
body’s guess. How can the ending -i¨
e that is associated with the perfect tense
be added to a U-stem verb? Would the initial -i- of the ending merge with
the ﬁnal -u of the verbal stem to form a diphthong -ui-, so that we would see
?unurrui¨
e for “has murmured”? The perfect tense “has expanded” could
hardly be ?ap´
alui¨
e, for the new diphthong ui would attract the stress and
leave the syllable immediately before it completely unaccented. Then the
long ´
a could hardly survive, for there seems to be a phonological rule pro-
hibiting a long vowel in a completely unstressed syllable unless this is also
the ﬁrst syllable of the word – and here it is not. Would we see ?apalui¨
e
with a short vowel, then? However, as we have argued earlier, the ending
-i¨
e that is used in the perfect tense apparently displaces the ﬁnal -a when
added to an A-stem verb, so it is entirely possible that it would also dis-
place the ﬁnal -u of a U-stem. From nurru-, palu- we would then simply see
the perfect-tense forms unurri¨
e “has murmured”, ap´
ali¨
e “has expanded”.
(Likely, -i¨
e as a gerundial or inﬁnitival ending would likewise displace the
ﬁnal -u, so that we could have ?nurri¨
e for “mumbling”. But “mumbling”
as a mere verbal noun could almost certainly be nurrul¨
e, though attested
286


examples of the abstract ending -l¨
e “-ing” involve A-stems instead.)
In the future tense we would presumably see the usual ending -uva. How-
ever, we can only speculate as to whether the initial -u- of the ending would
simply merge with the ﬁnal -u of the stem, so that the future tense of palu-
would be paluva, or whether the two u’s would combine to form one long
´
u, so that we would see pal´
uva instead.
18.4
The various uses of l´
a
In Lesson Nine, we introduced the negative verb um- “not do, not be” (past
tense ´
um¨
e according to Etym., future tense ´
uva according to F´
ıriel’s Song).
In all examples and exercises so far, we have used this verb + inﬁnitive
whenever a sentence is to be negated. However, using the negative verb is
not the only option available in this regard. Like English, Quenya does have
a separate word for “not”, namely l´
a (or la when unstressed). This word
may also be used for “no”.
The negative verb um- and the separate negation l´
a clearly coexist in
the language, since both were listed in the Etymologies (entries ugu/umu
vs. la). There are hardly any very speciﬁc rules for when to use one or the
other. If one uses the negative verb um-, it apparently takes the relevant
endings for tense and pronoun, while the verb it negates presumably appears
as an inﬁnitive: ´
Umen lelya, “I didn’t [ﬁrst person past tense] go [inf.]”. If
one uses the separate negation l´
a, the verb that is to be negated would itself
receive all relevant endings, just as if no negation were present: Lenden
“I went” could be negated as l´
a lenden or = “Not I went” = “I didn’t
go”. (Our few examples suggest that the preferred word order is to place l´
a
before the verb that is to be negated, though for all we know, lenden l´
a “I
went not” would also be acceptable. But one should not use an alternative
word-order where ambiguity can arise; see below.)
This is obviously an easier way to negate a sentence than using the neg-
ative verb + inﬁnitive; one simply starts with the non-negated sentence
and slips in one extra word. Indeed I introduce the word l´
a this late in
the course partly because I didn’t want to “spoil” my students with this
easy-to-construct negation before they had the chance to get familiar with
the negative verb. In many cases, using the negative verb may seem like
the more elegant method of negating sentences, and sometimes the word l´
a
“not” should perhaps be avoided because a similar form also has a quite
diﬀerent function (see below). Yet in some contexts it may be best to use l´
a
instead of the negative verb. In particular, it may seem strange to construct
the verb um- as a present or “continuative” form, corresponding to the En-
glish “is . . .-ing” construction. The form would be ´
uma, but should “the
Elf is not watching the Dwarf” be translated i Elda ´
uma tir¨
e i Nauco? I
guess anything is possible, but think I would rather start with the positive
287


sentence i Elda t´
ıra i Nauco and negate it by slipping in l´
a in front of the
verb: I Elda l´
a t´
ıra i Nauco. Likewise, it may be best to use the negation
l´
a in the perfect tense, especially since it is slightly uncertain what the per-
fect form of um- would be: ?´
umi¨
e with no augment since the stem begins
in a vowel, or perhaps ?um´
umi¨
e with the entire initial syllable repeated?
In any case, “I have not come” is perhaps best expressed as l´
a ut´
ulien.
Though (um)´
umien tul¨
e should be intelligible, it seems like a rather weird
construction.
Translating from Quenya to English one must sometimes take care to
connect the negation l´
a with the right verb. Notice the sentence alasaila
n´
a l´
a car¨
e tai mo nav¨
e m´
ara, translated “it is unwise not to do what
one judges good”. (VT42:34; mo is there said to be an indeﬁnite pronoun
“somebody, one”, apparently an alternative to quen. More obscure is the
form tai, which as we argued above may be a plural form of ta “that, it”,
hence “those”. If so, the sentence literally means “unwise [it] is not [to] do
those [things which] one judges good”. Notice the element ala- “un-” here
preﬁxed to saila “wise”; it is of course related to the negation l´
a.) For a
person used to English word order, it might be tempting to interpret the
words n´
a l´
a as a connected phrase “is not” and mistranslate **“it is not
unwise to do what one judges good”. However, if one bears in mind that l´
a
connects with the following verb, in this case the inﬁnitive car¨
e “to do”,
the misunderstanding can be avoided: The phrases are correctly divided as
alasaila n´
a “unwise [it] is” + l´
a car¨
e. . . “not to do. . . ” (etc.)
As this example shows, l´
a may be used to negate inﬁnitives as well,
and another example from VT42:34 indicates that it makes no diﬀerence
if the inﬁnitive is extended with the ending -ta to receive an object suﬃx:
l´
a caritas, navin, alasaila n´
a – literally “not to do it, I deem, unwise is”.
Tolkien himself oﬀered the translation “not doing this would be (I think)
unwise”. In one example, Tolkien even used l´
a to negate an extended in-
ﬁnitive in -ta that has no pronominal object ending attached: l´
a carita i
hamil m´
ara alasaila n´
a, “not to do what you judge good would be [lit-
erally ‘is’] unwise” (VT42:33). Here the extended inﬁnitive carita takes on
the meaning of a gerund, the entire relative sentence i hamil m´
ara “that
[which] you judge good” being its object. It seems, then, very likely that
l´
a can also be used to negate also the more regular gerund in -i¨
e. We have
no examples, but perhaps l´
a cari¨
e i hamil m´
ara. . . would be an equally
possible wording.
As for the unstressed variant of the negation l´
a, namely its shorter form
la, our sole certain attestation of it occurs in the sentence la navin cari-
talyas m´
ara, “I don’t judge your doing it good” (VT42:33; this is a way
of expressing “I do not advise you to do so”). Here the main stress presum-
ably falls on the ﬁrst syllable of the verb navin “I judge”, the negation la
receiving no stress. One would think, however, that an important word like
the negation (totally reversing the meaning of the sentence!) would normally
288


receive some stress, and in the exercises below, I have consistently used the
long/accented form l´
a.
The short form la would however have one thing to recommend it, namely
that it would not clash with a quite distinct word l´
a, which is used in
phrases having to do with comparison (though material appearing in Tyali¨
e
Tyellelli´
eva #16 seems to indicate that this second l´
a may also occur as
a shorter form la). According to Bill Welden’s article Negation in Quenya
(VT42:32–34), Tolkien was indeed somewhat troubled by this clash, and for
a while he actually abandoned the negation l´
a “no, not”. However, in the
last years of his life he reintroduced it, so we must live with the double
function of this word. In context, it is hardly diﬃcult to distinguish between
the two l´
a’s.
According to a otherwise unpublished Tolkien manuscript cited by Welden
in his article, the formula “A (n´
a) calima l´
a B” can be used for “A is
brighter than B” (notice that the copula n´
a “is” may be left out and under-
stood). If we want a full sentence with no algebra, we may ﬁll in A and B
to produce (say) Anar n´
a calima l´
a Isil, “[the] Sun is brighter than [the]
Moon”. However, this English translation diﬀers from the actual Quenya
wording in these respects: Calima is the simple adjective “bright”, not the
comparative form “brighter” (we are still not certain what that would look
like), and l´
a does not really mean “than”. We are told that this l´
a is prop-
erly a preposition “beyond”, so the Quenya sentence actually means “the
Sun is bright beyond the Moon”.
We can certainly imagine sentences including l´
a occurring with both its
meanings: I mindon l´
a n´
a halla l´
a i oron, “the tower is not taller than
the mountain” (literally “. . . tall beyond the mountain”). Here the negative
verb would certainly be preferable, if only for stylistic reasons: I mindon
um¨
e halla l´
a i oron. It may be possible to circumvent the ambiguities.
We are told that instead of l´
a “beyond” in phrases of comparison, one
may also use the preposition ep¨
e “before” – erroneously glossed “after” in
Welden’s article. Irrespective of this error, there actually is some evidence
suggesting that ep¨
e or a similar form did mean “after” at one point of
Tolkien’s ever-evolving linguistic scenario (apparently it was a variant of
the apa introduced in Lesson Fifteen). Because of the uncertainties relating
to ep¨
e, we will let it rest in peace here, and use l´
a despite its ambiguity.
Summary of Lesson Eighteen
In addition to the pronominal endings discussed earlier in this course, Quen-
ya also has various independent pronouns (see Vocabulary section below).
A pronoun like me “we” or “us” can receive endings for case (e.g. dative
men “for us, to us”) or, where two persons are concerned, dual endings (e.g.
met “[the two of] us”). – Some Quenya verbs are impersonal, requiring no
289


subject, but where someone is nonetheless aﬀected by the verbal action,
this someone can be mentioned as a dative form: Ora nin = “[it] impels
for me” = “I feel moved [to do something]”. – Quenya U-stem verbs, like
hlapu- “ﬂy [in the wind]”, form a particularly obscure group of verbs. The
only thing that is known with full certainty about such verbs is that the
active participle is formed by means of the normal ending -la, combined
with lengthening of the main vowel of the verb (unless it has to remain
short because of a following consonant cluster; thus the participle of nurru-
“grumble” is simply nurrula, though the participle of hlapu- is hl´
apula).
Early material suggests that the past tense of U-stem verbs is formed by
adding the past tense ending -n¨
e, though we have no examples from the
more LotR-compatible forms of Quenya. – The word l´
a has various uses. It
can be used as a negation “not” (apparently placed in front of the word,
usually the verb, that is to be negated). L´
a is also a preposition “beyond”,
and as such it is used in phrases having to do with comparison – VT42:32
citing the formula “A n´
a calima l´
a B” for “A is brighter than B” (literally
“A is bright beyond B” – notice that the adjective calima “bright” appears
in its simplest form, with no ending corresponding to the -er of “brighter”).

Exercises
Notice that in the exercises below, as well as in the keys, we use “you”
as the English equivalent of Quenya “L”-form pronouns (plural, or polite
singular, “you”), whereas “thee” is used as the equivalent of the intimate
singular object form tye. – As for negations, we will here practice the inde-
pendent negation l´

use independent subject pronouns, only the pronominal endings discussed
earlier.

Lesson 19
Pronouns in imperative phrases. Emphatic pronouns.
Question-words: Man, mana, manen. Postpositions.
19.1
Pronouns in imperative phrases
Imperative phrases may include pronominal elements. These pronouns may
refer either the subject of the imperative phrase (the party that is asked or
ordered to do something), or to the direct or indirect object of the requested
action.
Optional subject pronouns may be slipped in to make it clear whether the
speaker wants one or several persons to do something. Starting from the im-
perative exclamation heca! “be gone!” or “stand aside!”, Tolkien noted that
this word “often” appeared in an extended form “with reduced pronominal
aﬃxes of the 2nd person” (WJ:364). If a single person is the addressee of an
imperative, it can receive the suﬃx -t (doubtless related to the singular ob-
ject pronoun tye “thee”). So whereas the imperative heca! may be directed
at one person or several, the extended form hecat! is explicitly marked as
singular. It may be translated “get thee gone!” (Perhaps F¨
eanor’s harsh
dismissal of Melkor when the latter came to Formenos, translated “get thee
gone from my gate” near the end of Chapter 7 of the Silmarillion, went some-
thing like hecat andonyallo in the original Quenya?) Tolkien further noted
that in the plural, the simple imperative heca! could receive the ending -l,
so hecal! is an order with several addressees: “Be gone, [all of] you!” These
examples also demonstrate that when he wrote this, Tolkien had come to
see the distinction between the “T”-forms and the “L”-forms of the Second
Person as being primarily a distinction between singular and plural “you”.
Of course, matters are slightly muddied by the fact that “L”-forms like the
ending -l or -ly¨
e also function as a polite singular “you” (translated “thou”
in Nam´
ari¨
e). Of course, none can say whether the ending -l could be used
in an imperative phrase to denote a “polite” order with a single addressee.
Hecat! sg. and hecal! pl. are our only attested examples of this use of
the endings -t and -l. The imperative heca! is perhaps not a very typical
imperative. As outlined in Lesson Sixteen, instead of the ending -a an inde-
293


pendent imperative particle ´
a (or a) is normally employed, combined with
a following verbal stem. Attested examples include ´
a vala! “rule!” and a
laita! “praise!” If the endings -t, -l are to be slipped into such a phrase,
they must probably be attached to the verbal stem, e.g. a laitat! “praise!”
(to one person), a laital! “praise!” (to several persons).
Laita- “bless, praise” is of course an A-stem. Primary verbs like car-
“make, do” appear with the ending -¨
e in such commands, as is evident from
the negative imperative ´
ava car¨
e! “don’t do [it]!” (WJ:371). This -¨
e almost
certainly comes from an earlier -i, and before endings we would still see -i-,
just as in the aorist of these verbs. Hence probably ´
ava carit! “don’t do
[it]!” (to one person), plural ´
ava caril! “don’t do [it!]” (to several persons).
Or with a positive command like ´
a tul¨
e! “come!”, we could likewise have ´
a
tulit! if one person is asked to come, whereas ´
a tulil! would refer to more
than one: “Come ye!”
An imperative phrase may also include pronominal elements referring to
the direct or indirect object of the requested action. In the previous lesson we
referred to various independent pronouns. Nye “me”, me “us”, le “you”,
tye “thee”, ta “it” and te “them” can all appear as independent words;
indeed our sole attestation of te “them” involves an imperative phrase where
this word occurs by itself: A laita te, laita te! “bless them, bless them!”
(from the Cormallen Praise). However, Tolkien’s Quenya rendering of the
Lord’s Prayer indicates that object pronouns may also appear suﬃxed to
the imperative particle ´
a. The principle can be illustrated by a home-made
example: Consider a simple imperative phrase like ´
a tir¨
e! “watch!” If we
want to say “watch them”, slipping in the object pronoun te, it would be
possible to let it follow the verb (as in the attested example a laita te
“bless them”), hence ´
a tir¨
e te. However, it would apparently be equally
permissible to let the object pronoun come before the verb, in which case it
glues itself to the imperative particle ´
a. “Watch them!” could therefore be
´
at¨
e tir¨
e!
NOTE: Since te “them” now becomes the ﬁnal syllable of a word of several syllables,
the spelling conventions we have adopted require that the ﬁnal -e is here spelt with a
diaeresis: -¨
e. The same would apply to the ﬁnal -e of the object pronouns nye, me, le,
tye if they were directly suﬃxed to ´
a – e.g. ´
am¨
e tir¨
e “watch us”. Of course, this is just
an orthographic complication that has nothing to do with the structure of the language:
In many texts, Tolkien does not use the diaeresis at all.
Also dative pronouns (like nin “to/for me”, men “to/for us”, tien “to/for
them”) can be directly suﬃxed to the imperative particle ´
a; at least Tolkien’s
Quenya Lord’s Prayer contains an example of men being so suﬃxed. A
phrase like, say, “sing for us!” could thus be rendered ´
amen linda!
What happens if an imperative phrase contains two pronouns, denoting
both the direct and the indirect object? We have no Tolkien-made example
to guide us, but the imperative particle can hardly receive more than one
pronominal suﬃx, and the example a laita te indicates that a pronoun does
294


not necessarily have to be suﬃxed to the particle. So it would certainly be
permissible to let one of the pronouns, for either direct or indirect object,
remain an independent word and suﬃx only the other pronoun to the particle
´
a. “Do it for me!” could then be either ´
anin car¨
e ta! or ´
ata car¨
e nin!,
according to preference. (Perhaps one could also say ´
anin caritas!, using
an extended verbal stem carita- and the suﬃx -s for “it”.)
Tolkien’s translation of “do not lead us into temptation” in his Quenya
Lord’s Prayer reveals that the negated form of the imperative particle (“do
not!”) can also receive pronominal aﬃxes. By ca. 1960, in Quendi and El-
dar, Tolkien used ´
ava as the negative imperative, combining the particle ´
a
with the negation v´
a (-va). In his earlier Lord’s Prayer rendering he used
a slightly diﬀerent word for “do not” (incorporating the negation l´
a instead
of v´
a), but there is no reason to doubt that pronouns denoting the direct
or indirect object can be attached to the later form ´
ava as well. So while
“watch us!” could evidently be translated ´
am¨
e tir¨
e!, the negative command
“don’t watch us!” may probably be translated ´
avam¨
e tir¨
e!
19.2
Emphatic pronouns
In the previous lesson, we discussed a number of independent pronouns (also
mentioned in the section above). There also exist certain other pronouns
that likewise appear as separate words, though they are closely related to
the corresponding pronominal endings. These words function as emphatic
pronouns.
Consider the ﬁnal lines of Nam´
ari¨
e: Nai hiruvaly¨
e Valimar! Nai ely¨
e
hiruva! In LotR, Tolkien provided the translation “maybe thou shalt ﬁnd
Valimar! Maybe even thou shalt ﬁnd it!” Of course, hiruvaly¨
e means “thou
shalt ﬁnd” – “thou” being expressed by means of the pronominal ending
-ly¨
e. But then this is repeated as nai ely¨
e hiruva, “maybe even thou shalt
ﬁnd [it]”. Notice how the ending -ly¨
e is replaced by the independent word
ely¨
e, which is obviously closely related. Ely¨
e means simply “thou” or “you”,
but with special emphasis on this pronoun. Using such an independent form
is like italicizing the pronoun in English: “Maybe [none other than] thou
shalt ﬁnd.” Tolkien used the translation “even thou”, adding an extra word,
to bring out the emphatic quality of the pronoun. (The shorter independent
word for “you, thou”, le, is apparently not emphatic.)
Another independent emphatic pronoun is iny¨
e “I” – or, since it is em-
phatic, rather “I myself” or “even I”, “I and no one else”. In LR:61, Herendil
tells his father Elendil that he loves him, and Elendil responds in Quenya:
A yonya iny¨
e tye-m´
ela, “and I too, my son, I love thee” (the initial a,
apparently translated “and”, would seem to be a variant of the more usual
word ar – though a can also be a particle of address). Here the pronoun
iny¨
e, translated “I too” by Tolkien, gives special emphasis to Elendil’s own
295


identity: “I love you [just as you love me]”. Iny¨
e is more emphatic than the
shorter form ni, just like ely¨
e is more emphatic than le.
The form iny¨
e is obviously related to the pronominal ending -ny¨
e, and
Nam´
ari¨
e clearly demonstrates that ely¨
e corresponds to the ending -ly¨
e.
(Draft versions of Nam´
ari¨
e have the pronoun ell¨
e and the ending -ll¨
e in-
stead. Some think this has another meaning, perhaps plural “you” instead
of singular “thou”, but I tend to believe that Tolkien simply revised the
form of the pronoun without altering the sense.) It is evident from these
examples that emphatic pronouns can be derived from the corresponding
pronominal endings by adding the ending to some vowel. But what vowel?
We have an e- in ely¨
e “you”, but an i- in iny¨
e “I”. This emphatic word for
“I” may be exceptional in preferring i- as its initial vowel. The student may
remember that the ending for “my”, -nya, seems to prefer -i- as its connect-
ing vowel where one is required (as in atarinya “my father”, LR:61). The
close association of these First Person pronominal forms with the vowel i
seems to reﬂect the stem-vowel of the most basic stem ni “I”, listed in the
Etymologies. We may tentatively conclude that the other emphatic pronouns
show the initial vowel e-, as in ely¨
e. This is supported by Tolkien’s Quenya
version of the Lord’s Prayer, where he used emm¨
e as the emphatic pro-
noun corresponding to the pronominal ending -mm¨
e for exclusive “we”. It
occurs in his translation of the line “and forgive us our trespasses as we for-
give those who trespass against us”. Here, the pronoun is emphatic to draw
special attention to it (stressing the parallelism: “we” want God to forgive
us just like we in turn forgive others). It feels natural to let this pronoun
be emphatic in English as well, though this is indicated merely by putting
extra stress on it, and the distinction is not represented in writing (unless
one uses italics!) The Quenya system of using distinct emphatic pronouns is
undeniably more elegant.
While iny¨
e, ely¨
e (changed from ell¨
e) and emm¨
e are all the emphatic
pronouns occurring in published and soon-to-be-published material, we can
conﬁdently extrapolate at least some more forms. The exclusive emphatic
pronoun for “we”, emm¨
e, would obviously correspond to the inclusive vari-
ant elm¨
e (just like the exclusive ending for “we”, -mm¨
e, corresponds to
the inclusive ending -lm¨
e). Possibly the ending -nt¨
e for “they” would cor-
respond to an independent word ent¨
e.
Other forms are somewhat less certain. The ending for dual inclusive “we”
is uncertain, but if it is -lw¨
e, we would expect elw¨
e as the independent
emphatic pronoun. The form ely¨
e can function as a singular “you”, as is
evident from Tolkien’s translation “even thou” in his LotR rendering of
Nam´
ari¨
e. As I have suggested earlier, the “L” forms of the Second Person
may seem to indicate either a polite singular “you” or a plural “you”; perhaps
ely¨
e could assume the latter sense as well. The “T” forms of the Second
Person, exempliﬁed by the object pronoun tye and the ending -t that may
be used in the imperative, seem to denote an intimate and usually singular
296


“you”, but it is uncertain what the emphatic form would be. It depends
on how we reconstruct the longer form of the ending -t. If it is -ty¨
e, the
emphatic pronoun would most likely be ety¨
e. But I have also given some
reasons for believing that Tolkien meant -t to represent an older -k, in which
case the longer variant of the ending might well be -cc¨
e – and then emphatic
pronoun would probably be ecc¨
e.
Things are also rather obscure in the Third Person. It is clear that the
emphatic pronouns are derived from the long forms of the pronominal end-
ings. The word iny¨
e “I” corresponds to the long subject ending -ny¨
e, not
its shorter (and more common) form -n; likewise, ely¨
e “thou” corresponds
to the long ending -ly¨
e, though this ending may also appear in the shorter
form -l. There are hardly any short emphatic pronouns **in, **el to go
with the short endings. Our problem is that in the Third Person, the short
ending -s is the only form attested in material Tolkien certainly intended to
be LotR-compatible. We have earlier theorized that -s may correspond to
a longer ending -ry¨
e (for earlier -sy¨
e, -zy¨
e); it would then have the same
relationship to the ending -rya “his, her” as the ending -ly¨
e “you” has to
the ending -lya “your”. If such an ending -ry¨
e exists, it could correspond
to an emphatic pronoun ?ery¨
e “(even) he/she”. But when we start extrap-
olating from extrapolations, the risk of losing contact with Tolkien’s actual
intentions obviously becomes acute.
We know a few more things about the emphatic pronouns, though. They
can receive case endings; in Tolkien’s Quenya rendering of the Lord’s Prayer,
the emphatic pronoun emm¨
e “we” once occurs with the dative ending -n
attached: Emmen. (This also conﬁrms that pronouns take the simplest case
endings, that is, the ones used with singular nouns – even if the pronoun is
plural by its meaning: “We” must refer to several persons, but the simplest
dative ending -n is used instead of the plural form -in.) As pointed out
in the previous lesson, the 1st person dative form nin “to me, for me” is
particularly well attested, but if one wants to say “for me myself”, “for me
[and no one else]”, it would be better to start from the emphatic form iny¨
e
and derive the dative form inyen.
We have already cited the ﬁnal lines of Nam´
ari¨
e, where part of one sen-
tence is repeated with special emphasis on the pronoun: Nai hiruvaly¨
e
Valimar! Nai ely¨
e hiruva! From this example it appears that if a pronom-
inal ending is replaced by an independent pronoun, the ending is removed
from the verb (not nai ely¨
e hiruvaly¨
e with both an independent pronoun
and the corresponding ending still attached to the verb). Yet in the draft
version, when the pronoun ely¨
e was still ell¨
e, Tolkien did use precisely that
system: Nai ell¨
e hiruvall¨
e. He apparently decided that this version was
somewhat over-complete, and writers should probably avoid this system.
Yet the verb following an emphatic pronoun should perhaps receive at
least the plural ending -r if the pronoun is plural. If we want to transform
(say) hiruvamm¨
e “we shall ﬁnd” into two words to put special emphasis on
297


the pronoun “we”, I guess the resulting phrase would be emm¨
e hiruvar,
not **emm¨
e hiruva. If the pronoun ely¨
e does denote both singular po-
lite “you/thou” as well as plural “you”, the following verb may then reveal
in what sense it is used. In nai ely¨
e hiruva! the pronoun must be singu-
lar (“thou”) since there is no -r attached to the verb. Perhaps nai ely¨
e
hiruvar! would also be a possible sentence, but here it would be clear that
a plural “you” is intended. If this is so, Frodo could after all be certain that
Galadriel addressed Nam´
ari¨
e to him alone (“thou”), not to the entire Fel-
lowship (“you”) – though the pronoun ely¨
e as such is perhaps ambiguous
in this regard.
As pointed out above, the emphatic pronouns can receive case endings,
as can the shorter independent pronouns discussed in the previous lesson.
It is, however, somewhat uncertain whether the endings for genitive and
possessive should be added to such independent pronouns. Obviously, some
kind of independent words for (say) “mine” or “yours” would be required
to have a fully functional language. The ending -lya can be used to express
“your”, as in parmalya “your book”, but how do we say “the book is
yours”? Published examples of Quenya provide no clues.
It has long been theorized that not only the subject endings that may
be suﬃxed to verbs, but also the possessive endings that may be added
to nouns (like -nya “my” or -lya “your”), have corresponding emphatic
forms. This has never been explicitly conﬁrmed. However, given the fact
that the ending -ly¨
e “you, thou” corresponds to an independent form ely¨
e
“you” (emphatic), it certainly seems plausible to assume that the ending -lya
“your” could correspond to an independent form elya “yours”. This word
could then be used in a sentence like i parma n´
a elya, “the book is yours”.
But it could also be used for special emphasis, so that while parmalya
means simply “your book”, elya parma would mean “your [and no one
else’s] book”.
If the theory holds, other emphatic possessive pronouns would be erya
“his, her”, elma “our” [inclusive]” and emma “our [exclusive]” – of course
corresponding to the endings -rya, -lma, -mma. The attested word elya
for “your, thy” would be either a plural “your” or a polite singular “your”
(or “thy”); the intimate singular “your” could be something like ecca or
etya. If the ending for dual inclusive “our” is -lwa, we could have elwa
as the corresponding emphatic pronoun. An even bigger “if” relates to the
emphatic word for “their”, since it must be extrapolated in two steps: As-
suming that the ending -nt¨
e for “they” corresponds to an unattested ending
-nta “their”, we may assume that it this ending in turn corresponds to
an emphatic possessive pronoun enta. As for the independent form of the
possessive pronoun “my”, corresponding to the ending -nya, we would prob-
ably expect the form inya (since the subject ending -ny¨
e corresponds to an
independent form iny¨
e).
These extrapolations are not entirely unproblematic. Some of these forms
298


actually occur in Tolkien’s published writings, but with quite diﬀerent mean-
ings. Inya, for instance, is mentioned in the Etymologies – but there it is
not an emphatic word for “my”, it as an adjective “female”, of a quite dif-
ferent derivation (see the entry ini). Erya, which we have suggested as an
emphatic word for “his” or “her” (corresponding to the ending -rya), would
coincide in form with the adjective erya “single, sole” (Etym, entry ere).
The student may already have noticed that enta as an emphatic word for
“their” would clash with the demonstrative “that, yonder” (Etym, entry en).
Since demonstratives may seem to follow the noun they connect with (cf.
UT:305: vanda sina = “this oath”), we could perhaps distinguish coa enta
“yonder house” from enta coa “their house”. As for our extrapolated forms
inya and erya coinciding with Tolkien-made adjectives of quite diﬀerent
meaning, what can I say? Some, no doubt, would feel that this throws con-
siderable doubt on this whole business of extrapolating emphatic possessive
pronouns to go with the attested subject pronouns. Actually I think these
extrapolations are about as plausible as any forms not directly attested can
be. Given the ﬂuid state of the Quenya language in general and its pronouns
in particular, diﬀerent stages of Tolkien’s ever-changing conception are quite
likely to involve coinciding word-forms of diﬀerent meaning. However, in the
exercises below, I focus on the better-attested subject pronouns, like iny¨
e
and ely¨
e.
19.3
Question-words
Many English words frequently used in questions show an initial wh-: “who?”,
“what?”, “where?”, “which?”, “whose?”, “why?” etc. In Tolkien’s Elvish, an
initial ma- has similar connotations; he referred to the “Eldarin interrog-
ative element ma, man” (PM:357). This “element” Tolkien seems to have
borrowed from Semitic languages; cf. for instance Hebrew ma = “what?”
We have nothing like a complete list of Elvish interrogative words, but
some of them do occur in published material. Best attested is the word for
“who”, man, which occurs in a question in the middle of Nam´
ari¨
e: S´
ı man
i yulma nin enquantuva? “Now who will reﬁll the cup for me?” Man =
“who” occurs repeatedly in the Markirya poem, e.g. in the question man
tiruva f´
ana cirya[?] “Who will heed [/watch] a white ship?” (In one out
of ﬁve occurrences, Markirya as printed in MC:221–222 has men instead,
but this must be a misreading of Tolkien’s manuscript; there seems to be no
grammatical variation that could explain the variant form.) Perhaps man
can receive case endings, so that we can have (say) the genitive form mano
= “whose?”
If man is “who” (referring to people), what is the word for “what” (re-
ferring to things)? In LR:58, Tolkien apparently lets man cover “what?” as
well: Man-i¨
e? is translated “what is it?” This is hardly LotR-style Quenya;
299


the ending -i¨
e = “is” was almost certainly abandoned later. F´
ıriel’s Song
also uses man in the sense of “what”: Man . . . ant´
ava nin Il´
uvatar[?]
= “What will the Father [Il´
uvatar, God] give me?” Whether Tolkien at one
point intended man to mean both “who” and “what”, or whether he sim-
ply changed his mind back and forth regarding the precise meaning of man,
cannot be determined now. Turning to a post-LotR source, we ﬁnd the ques-
tion mana i·coimas Eldaron[?], which is translated “what is the coimas
[”life-bread” = Sindarin lembas] of the Eldar?” (PM:395; a variant reading
occurs in PM:403). How are we to interpret this word mana, that would
seem to correspond to “what is” in the translation? It could be a word ma
“what” (which would be a direct borrowing from Hebrew!) + the copula
n´
a “is”, here directly suﬃxed and shortened to -na. However, the form ma
is known to have at least two diﬀerent meanings in Quenya (see the next
lesson), so I tend to doubt that Tolkien intended it to mean “what?” as well.
Rather mana is simply a word for “what”, and there is no explicit copula
“is” in the sentence mana i·coimas[?] = “what [is] the life-bread?” It may
be that mana “what” can receive case-endings. Published material provides
no word for “why?”, but by one suggestion we can work around this gap by
adding the dative ending -n to mana – the resulting form manan meaning
literally “what for?”
By its form, mana resembles the demonstratives sina “this”, tana “that”
and yana “that (yonder)”. Since vanda sina means “this oath” (UT:305,
317), perhaps vanda mana? would mean “what oath?” or “which oath?”
Mana vanda? would rather mean “what [is] an oath?”, given Tolkien’s
example mana i·coimas[?] = “what [is] the life-bread?”
The same late document that provides this example also includes a word
for “how?”, appearing as part of the question manen lamb¨
e Quendion
ahyan¨
e[?] = “How did the language of Elves change?” (PM:395). Interest-
ingly, this word manen “how?” seems to include the instrumental ending
-nen, added to the “interrogative element” ma- (PM:347). Manen could
mean, literally, “what by?” (it may even be a contraction of mananen
for all we know). It seems highly plausible that other case endings than
that of the instrumental can be added to ma-. Perhaps we can have loca-
tive mass¨
e? “where?”, ablative mallo “whence?/where from?” and manna
“whither/where to?”, ﬁlling further gaps in our vocabulary. However, the ex-
ercises below only involve the attested forms man “who?”, mana “what?”
and manen “how?”
19.4
Postpositions
We have introduced various prepositions, such as nu “under”, or “over” or
ve “as, like”. Prepositions are so called because they are typically “posi-
tioned” before (pre) the word(s) they connect with. In Quenya and English
300


alike, one would say nu alda “under a tree” – not **alda nu “a tree un-
der”. (Of course, the word order may be quite garbled in poetry, as when the
LotR version of Nam´
ari¨
e has Vardo tellumar nu luini “Varda’s domes
under blue” for “under Varda’s blue domes”. Here, we are rather discussing
the normal, non-poetic word order.)
There are also postpositions, similar in function to the prepositions, but
coming after (post) the word or words they connect with. In English, the
word ago may be seen as a postposition, since it comes at the end of phrases
like “three years ago”. Some languages would use a preposition instead,
expressing this meaning something like “before three years”. Interestingly,
a word simply glossed “ago” is mentioned in the Etymologies: Y´
a. It is not
mentioned or exempliﬁed elsewhere, and since its English gloss is all we have
to go on, we may assume that y´
a is a postposition in Quenya as well. If so,
“three years ago” could be translated directly as neld¨
e loar y´
a.
At an older stage, Elvish apparently had many postpositions. Tolkien
stated that at the oldest stage, “prepositional” elements were normally “at-
tached” – apparently meaning suﬃxed – to noun stems (WJ:368). Many
of the Quenya case endings Tolkien clearly meant to represent originally
independent elements that had merged into the noun they followed. For in-
stance, the ending -nna for allative is obviously related to the preposition
na or ana, likewise meaning “to, towards”. Yet Quenya had at least a few
postpositions that had not evolved into case endings, but still appeared as
independent words. Whereas y´
a discussed above is only attested as an iso-
lated word mentioned in Etym, the word pella “beyond” appears in actual
Quenya texts, and it does seem to be a postposition. Nam´
ari¨
e has And´
un¨
e
pella for “beyond the West”, and this is apparently not just another ex-
ample of a poetic word order, for Tolkien did not alter this phrase in his
prose version of the song. (The word And´
un¨
e “West” is an alternative to
the more usual word N´
umen. And´
un¨
e may also be deﬁned as “sunset” or
even “evening”.) Pella is used as a postposition in the Markirya poem as
well, where it connects with a noun inﬂected for plural ablative: Elenillor
pella is translated “from beyond the stars” (literally “from stars beyond”).
Whether pella could also be used as a preposition, just like its English
gloss “beyond”, is impossible to say. Another word for “beyond”, the l´
a that
is also used in comparison, does seem to be a preposition (and perhaps the
ﬁnal syllable of pella is meant to be related to this l´
a). Even so, I would use
pella as a postposition only, employing the word order observed in Nam´
ari¨
e
and Markirya alike.
Summary of Lesson Nineteen
Imperative phrases may in various ways include pronouns. If an order has
one single addressee, the ending -t (basically meaning “thou”) may be added
301


to the verb of the imperative phrase; if several people are asked to do some-
thing, the ending -l (basically meaning “you”, plural) may be used instead.
Pronouns denoting the direct or indirect object of the imperative may glue
themselves to the imperative particle ´
a. – The (long forms of the) pronomi-
nal subject endings that may be suﬃxed to verbs may also be used to derive
independent emphatic pronouns by adding the relevant ending to e-. For in-
stance, the subject endings -ly¨
e “you, thou” and -mm¨
e “we” correspond to
the independent emphatic pronouns ely¨
e “(even) thou” and emm¨
e “(even)
we”. The emphatic word for “I”, corresponding to the ending -ny¨
e, however
shows i- rather than e- as its initial vowel: iny¨
e. – Quenya interrogative
words apparently show an initial ma-; attested examples are man “who”,
mana “what” and manen “how”. – Postpositions are similar in function to
prepositions, but follow rather than precede the word(s) they connect with.
The word pella “beyond” seems to function as a postposition; Nam´
ari¨
e has
And´
un¨
e pella (not ?pella And´
un¨
e) for “beyond the West”. The word y´
a
is glossed “ago” (Etym, entry YA), so perhaps it functions as a postposition
just like its English gloss.
Vocabulary
ots¨
ea “seventh”
tolt¨
ea “eighth” (In a late document Tolkien actually changed this form to told¨
ea:
VT42:25, 31. Apparently he considered changing the word for “8” from tolto to
toldo. We may accept toldo “8” and told¨
ea “8th” as valid variants, but in the
exercises below I prefer tolt¨
ea – to go with tolto, the form of the word “8” as
listed in the Etymologies.)
iny¨
e “I” (emphatic pronoun)
ely¨
e “you, thou” (emphatic pronoun)
emm¨

since it forms the logical counterpart of emm¨
e, this extrapolation from the ending
-lm¨
e seems so plausible that I will use it in the exercises below.)
man “who?”
mana “what?” (according to one interpretation of the sentence where this word occurs)
manen “how?”
pella “beyond” (postposition)
y´
a “ago” (postposition like its English gloss?)
´
ır¨
e “when”
302


NOTE on the word ´
ır¨
e “when”: This is (almost certainly) not an interrogative word,
despite its English gloss. A question like “when will you come?” can hardly be translated
**´
ır¨
e tuluvaly¨
e? No Quenya word for “when?” as a genuine question-word has been
published, though it may be possible to work around this gap – for instance, we could use
a circumlocution like l´
u mana(ss¨
e)? = “(at) what time?” The word´
ır¨
e is used for “when”
in the sense that it introduces information about when something occurs; it is attested in
F´
ıriel’s Song. The relevant phrases are not quite LotR-style Quenya, but the use of ´
ır¨
e
may be noted all the same: Y´
eva tyel ar i-narquelion, ir¨
e ilqua y´
eva n´
otina = “there
will be an end and the Fading, when all is counted”; man . . . ant´
ava nin Il´
uvatar . . .
´
ır¨
e Anarinya queluva? = “what will the Father give me . . . when my Sun faileth?” At
present we have no later attestation of such a word, and since it is highly useful, we may
well adopt´
ır¨
e “when” into our attempted Uniﬁed or Standard Quenya. Many post-Tolkien
writers have used it already. It has been suggested that the initial ´
ı- of ´
ır¨
e is related to the
deﬁnite article i “the”, whereas the ﬁnal -r¨
e can be equated with the word r´
e “[24-hour]
day” (the word aur¨
e refers to the daylight period only). If so, ´
ır¨
e basically means “the
day” – and of course, “what will the Father give me . . . the day my Sun faileth” would still
make sense. However, it may seem that the word ´
ır¨
e “when” existed long before the word
r´
e “day”; the latter apparently emerged as Tolkien was writing the LotR Appendices. I
wouldn’t hesitate to use ´
ır¨
e for “when” in general (not limiting its application to “the day
when. . . ”)
Exercises
As described above, Tolkien sometimes added extra words when translating
emphatic pronouns, e.g. ely¨
e = “even thou” (to bring out the emphatic
quality of the word). However, in the keys to the exercises below, as well as
in the “Translate into Quenya” section, we have adopted the simpler system
of italicizing emphatic pronouns (e.g. ely¨
e = you; by the way, we will use
this translation rather than “thou” since the “L”-form pronouns may seem
to be ambiguous as to number, just like English “you”).

Lesson 20
The obscure verb “to be”. Ma as a possible interrogative
particle. Sa introducing nominal clauses.
We are now fast exhausting the reasonably certain “facts” about Quenya
(though as I have tried to make clear, even many of the “facts” must be
considered tentative deductions). This last regular lesson is already moving
far into the twilight zone of linguistic obscurities.
20.1
The verb “to be”
(including some remarks on the form ¨
ea)
The various forms of the verb “to be” have always been a problem. The
LotR version of Nam´
ari¨
e includes the copula n´
a “is”. A draft version of
the same poem combines the copula with a plural subject, resulting in the
form nar “are”. In July 2001, the future-tense form nauva “will be” ﬁnally
turned up in Vinyar Tengwar 42 p. 34. We have mentioned and practiced
all of these forms before.
Several tense-forms, as well as the inﬁnitive, are missing. To start with
the inﬁnitive, what is “to be” in Quenya? We have no other clue than the
apparent fact the inﬁnitive of A-stem verbs is identical to the verbal stem
itself, with no additions. In Etym, nˆ
a is listed as the “stem of [the] verb ‘to
be’ in Q[uenya]”. So conceivably, n´
a may also function as an inﬁnitive: “I
want to be an Elf” = ?Merin n´
a Elda. But of course, Tolkien may have
imagined something entirely diﬀerent.
Another question lacking a clear answer: Can n´
a, nauva and other tense-
forms be combined with pronominal endings? We may have one example to
guide us. In the very early (some would even say ﬁrst) “Qenya” poem Nar-
qelion, written in 1915 or 1916, Tolkien used the form n´
are. Since there is
no straightforward Tolkien-made translation of this poem, we cannot be en-
tirely certain what it means. Christopher Gilson, analyzing the entire poem
in light of the almost contemporaneous Qenya Lexicon, concluded that n´
are
may mean “it is” (VT40:31). A 3rd person marker -re (or if you like, -r¨
e)
was perhaps present in Tolkien’s later forms of Quenya as well, though at
305


the later stages we might expect it to mean “she” rather than “it” – see Les-
son 15. If the regular pronominal endings can be attached to n´
a, we would
expect forms like the following:
n´
an or n´
any¨
e “I am”
n´
at “you [intimate singular] are”, perhaps also with a longer form (nacc¨
e
or n´
aty¨
e???)
n´
al or n´
aly¨
e “you [plural or polite singular] are”
n´
as “he/she/it is”, conceivably with a longer form ?n´
ary¨
e; there may
also be gender-speciﬁc forms n´
aro “he is”, n´
ar¨
e “she is” (the latter being
attested, sort of, in Narqelion)
namm¨
e “we [exclusive] are”, nalm¨
e “we [inclusive] are”, and perhaps
something like nalw¨
e “we [dual inclusive] are”
nant¨
e “they are”
Notice that the long ´
a of n´
a would be shortened whenever a consonant
cluster follows, as when the endings -mm¨
e, -lm¨
e, -lw¨
e, -nt¨
e are attached.
I assume that the endings with a consonant + y (-ny¨
e and -ly¨
e, plus the
two extrapolated endings ?-ty¨
e and ?-ry¨
e) would not have the power to
shorten a preceding vowel. Compare the ´
a of m´
a “hand” remaining long
before the possessive pronominal ending -rya “her” in Nam´
ari¨
e: m´
aryat
“her hands”, dual. (The future tense nauva “will be” would be able to
receive all pronominal endings with no modiﬁcations: nauvan or nauvany¨
e
“I will be”, nauvalm¨
e “we will be”, etc.)
Perhaps the verb n´
a can even receive two pronominal endings, for subject
and predicate, e.g. n´
anyes = “I am he”. (Compare the Tolkien-made form
ut´
uvienyes = “I have found it”, the second ending denoting the object.)
But of course, all of the above may be nonsense. The word n´
a “is” and
pronominal endings like -n “I” are attested separately, but combining them
to produce n´
an for “I am” could for all we know be just as wrong as saying
“I is” in English. In the case of the verb “to be”, Tolkien may very well have
dreamed up some wonderfully irregular forms, which only his unpublished
manuscripts can ever reveal.
Luckily, there is a way to get around the whole problem, and that is
to simply use an independent pronoun and leave out the entire copula “to
be”: It is understood. When translating “blessed art thou” in his Quenya
rendering of the Hail Mary, Tolkien simply wrote the word for “blessed”
immediately followed by the pronoun ely¨
e “thou”. There is no copula “art”
in the Quenya text. So we can apparently feel free to build copula-less sen-
tences like iny¨
e Elda “I [am] an Elf”, ely¨
e ´
um¨
ea “you [are] evil” or “thou
[art] evil”. (If a plural “you” is intended, the adjective should probably be
pl.: ´
umi¨
e.) The shorter, less emphatic pronouns would presumably work
just as well: Ni Elda, le ´
um¨
ea, etc.
Yet we can’t always do without the verb “to be”, and another problem has
to do with the past tense “was”. We have no certain attestations of it. Adding
306


the normal past-tense marker -n¨
e to the stem nˆ
a would of course produce
something like ?n´
an¨
e, but this awkward form seems most improbable. In all
likelihood, Tolkien actually envisioned an irregular form. A form n´
e “was”
has long been rumored to occur in Tolkien’s unpublished papers. The closest
we have ever got to having this assumption conﬁrmed would be Christopher
Gilson’s analysis of the same very early “Qenya” poem referred to above,
Narqelion. In Vinyar Tengwar #40, page 12–13, we ﬁnd Gilson trying to
decipher what he calls an “especially enigmatic” phrase from the poem. It
incorporates the form n´
e, and Gilson argues (p. 13):
The preterite [= past tense] of the verb ‘to be’ is not given in
[the] Q[enya] L[exicon], but this tense-form is listed for many
verbs, and frequently identiﬁed as such. The Qenya preterite has
a variety of formations, but one of the familiar types is seen in
kanda- ‘blaze’, pret. kandane. . . It is possible that forms like
kanda-ne actually arose as a construction with the verb-stem
plus a form of the verb ‘to be’, i.e. that a meaning like ‘blazed’
derived syntactically as in English phrases like ‘was blazing’ or
‘did blaze’, with an originally tenseless form of the stem kanda-
‘(to) blaze, blazing’ combined with the past tense expressed in
the ending -ne ‘was’. . . The present tense of the verb ‘to be’ is
given in QL as n´
a ‘it is’ . . . and if the preterite is n´
e or ne, there
would be a parallel with certain other verbs where the present
vs. preterite is marked solely by a change of -a to -e, as in panta-
‘open, unfold, spread’, pret. pante, or sanga- ‘pack tight’, pret.
sange.
Since it so happens that Mr. Gilson has access to virtually all of Tolkien’s
linguistic papers, he must know perfectly well whether a form n´
e “was” oc-
curs in the material or not. We may assume, then, that Gilson feels that he
would be violating somebody’s copyright if he were to say loud and clear
that “n´
e is the Qenya word for was” – and so he has to pretend that he is
merely deducing this word from already published material. Remembering
that Tolkien must surely have discussed the various forms of “to be” in the
vast amount of linguistic manuscripts that he left behind, and combining
Gilson’s article with more recent statements made by his group to the ef-
fect that they would not write something they know to be wrong, we can
apparently treat n´
e = “was” as an as-good-as-attested word.
However, even if such a word did exist in the early forms of “Qenya”, it
may of course have been abandoned in the more LotR-compatible forms of
the language that emerged decades later. It may be noted, though, that the
past tense ending -n¨
e was never abandoned – and if Gilson’s theory that
there is a connection between this ending and the verb “was” does reﬂect
Tolkien’s actual ideas, the word n´
e “was” may have survived into LotR-
style Quenya. Anyhow, writers can hardly do without a word for “was”, and
307


currently we have no better alternative than n´
e. Some writers have used it,
and based on the pair n´
a “is” / nar “are”, people have also extrapolated a
form ner “were” to be used in conjunction with plural or multiple subjects.
If the present tense n´
a “is” can be combined with pronominal endings,
this would presumably be true of n´
e as well (it would then be reduced to
ne- with a short -e- before the endings -mm¨
e, -lm¨
e, -lw¨
e, -nt¨
e, just like
we must assume that n´
a- is shortened to na- before these endings). But
rather than being combined with pronominal endings, it may well be that
the copula would most often simply be omitted in the past tense as well,
an independent pronoun being used instead of an ending: Ely¨
e ´
um¨
ea =
past tense “you [were] evil” or present tense “you [are] evil”, according to
context. (However, I suspect that the future-tense copula nauva “will be”
would rarely be omitted like this.)
Five Quenya tenses are attested: Present (or continuative), aorist, past,
future and perfect. The verb “to be” may not make any distinction between
present and aorist (n´
a “is” covering both); the past tense “was” may be n´
e
as discussed above, and the future tense is attested as nauva “will be”. This
leaves only the perfect tense – “has been”. Normally, the perfect is formed
by preﬁxing an augment similar to the stem-vowel, lengthening the stem-
vowel in its normal place and adding the ending -i¨
e, e.g. ut´
uli¨
e “has come”
from the stem tul “come”. However, it is less than clear how the stem nˆ
a
could be ﬁtted into this pattern. A form ?an´
ai¨
e would be quite unstable;
the group ´
ai would tend to become a normal diphthong ai. Yet ?anai¨
e still
does not strike me as a particularly likely form, and I could recommend
it to really desperate writers only. Presently it is simply impossible to tell
how the Eldar would say “has been” (presumably a very frequent word,
since Tolkienian Elves “were ever more and more involved in the past” –
VT41:12!)
The imperative of n´
a is also a matter of conjecture. It is far from obvious
how to say “be!” as in “be good!” I have used the form ´
ana, combining n´
a
(-na) with a preﬁxed variant of the imperative particle ´
a. By its form, this
imperative ´
ana “be!” would have the same relationship to n´
a as Tolkien’s
word ´
ava “don’t!” has to the simple negation v´
a “no!” Yet ´
ana remains an
extrapolation, and if we could have asked Tolkien what he actually had in
mind, I would have been somewhat surprised if this had been his answer. So
please think of ´
ana as a form which would ﬁt into Tolkien’s general system,
but which is not (as far as I know!) Tolkienian as such.
In addition to the “N” forms of the verb “to be” (n´
a/nar, n´
e, nauva) a
few entirely diﬀerent forms of related meaning occurs in the material. The
pre-LotR text F´
ıriel’s Song has ye for “is” and y´
eva for “will be”. Instead
of appearing as independent words they may also be turned into endings, -i¨
e
and -i´
eva, attested in such forms as m´
ari¨
e “is good” and hostaini´
eva “will
be counted” (cf. m´
ara “good”, hostaina “gathered, countered”). However,
as I pointed out in Lesson Four, Tolkien may seem to have abandoned such
308


forms. The ending -i¨
e has so many other meanings (gerundial ending as
in enyali¨
e “recalling”, abstract ending as in veri¨
e “boldness”, feminine
ending as in Vali¨
e “female Vala”) that Tolkien may have decided that it
should not be burdened with the meaning “is” as well. A few writers have
used the ending -i¨
e “is”, but my advice would be to let these formations
from F´
ıriel’s Song rest in peace.
Another verb we should consider is deﬁnitely not a word Tolkien aban-
doned, for it is found in writings postdating the publication of LotR – with
Nam´
ari¨
e, incorporating the verb n´
a “is”, in it. Thus it is clearly meant
to coexist with n´
a, and probably expresses a somewhat diﬀerent shade of
meaning. We are talking about the verb ¨
ea (or with a capital E, E¨
a).
Readers of the Silmarillion will remember this word from Tolkien’s cre-
ation myth. God, Eru Il´
uvatar, grants objective existence to the Music of the
Ainur with this word: “I know the desire of your minds that what ye have
seen should verily be . . . even as ye yourselves are, and yet other. Therefore
I say: E¨
a! Let these things Be!” (Ainulindal¨
e). Tolkien explained that E¨
a
as a name of the universe is not originally a noun, but actually a verb: “The
Elves called the World, the Universe, E¨
a – It is” (footnote in Letters:284).
“This world, or Universe, [the Creator] calls E¨
a, an Elvish word that means
‘It is’ or ‘Let it Be’” (MR:330).
So ¨
ea can be either the present (or aorist) tense “[it] is” or the imperative
“let it be!” (In the latter sense it would parallel such one-word imperatives
in -a as heca! “be gone!” or ela! “look!”) How does ¨
ea “is” diﬀer in meaning
from n´
a? It has been suggested that one of these verbs means “is” referring
merely to some particular instance, while the other refers to a permanent
or habitual state. In a sentence like “the man is drunk”, one word for “is”
would simply indicate that “the man” is drunk right now, whereas the other
would imply that he is a drunkard by habit. Parallels to such a system can
be found in Spanish (a language Tolkien loved).
Given the extreme scarcity of source material, nothing can be ruled out
at this stage, but I would put my money on another theory. It should be
noted that Tolkien translated ¨
ea not only as “is”, he also used the rendering
“exists” (VT39:7). This suggests that ¨
ea has a more absolute meaning than
n´
a. The verb ¨
ea is related to the noun engw¨
e “thing” (see below), a “thing”
being perceived as “something that exists”. It may be that n´
a is a mere
copula used in phrases describing the state of something, introducing a noun
(samb¨
e sina n´
a caimasan ”this room is a bedchamber”), an adjective
(samb¨
e sina n´
a pitya ”this room is small”) or even a prepositional phrase
(samb¨
e sina n´
a ve i samb¨
e yass¨
e hirnenyet, “this room is like the room
where I found them”). On the other hand, ¨
ea refers to the solid, independent
existence or presence of some subject, and it can perhaps be used with no
other additions than this subject (e.g. Eru ¨
ea = “God exists”). Tolkien
informs us that the word ¨
eala, by its form obviously the active participle of
¨
ea, was also used as a noun “being” – denoting a spirit whose natural state is
309


to exist without a physical body. Balrogs, for instance, were ¨
ealar (MR:165).
Basically, the word only refers to “existing” ones. At the beginning of a
sentence, the verb ¨
ea may possibly be used in the same sense as English
“there is”, to assert the existence or presence of something: E¨
a malta i
orontissen “[there] is gold in the mountains”, ¨
ea n´
er i sambess¨
e “[there]
is a man in the room”, ¨
ear neld¨
e nissi i coass¨
e, “[there] are three women
in the house”.
However, all the sentences in the previous paragraph were constructed by
me. One of our very few Tolkien-made examples of ¨
ea occurring in an actual
sentence forms part of Cirion’s Oath. E¨
a turns up as the verb of a relative
sentence: i Eru i or ily¨
e mahalmar ¨
ea tennoio, “the One [God] who is
above all thrones forever”. Since the literal meaning could well be that Eru
exists in this sublime position, this does not contradict the interpretation
set out above. It should be noted that ¨
ea, rather than n´
a, is the verb to
use when describing the position of something (the position being speciﬁed
either by a phrase including a preposition, like or ily¨
e mahalmar “above
all thrones” in the sentence above, or by a noun appearing in the locative
case). Perhaps we could have sentences like i samb¨
e yass¨
e ¨
ea i harma ¨
ea
or i samb¨
e yass¨
e ¨
ea i n´
er s´
ı “the room where the treasure is, is above
the room where the man is now” – referring not so much to mere states as
to existence, presence, position. This is the best the present grammarian can
do with so few examples.
How is ¨
ea inﬂected? E¨
a itself would seem to be the present or aorist form;
the imperative (used by Eru in the Ainulindal¨
e) is identical. Perhaps ¨
ea can
also function as the inﬁnitive. The future tense could be something like
euva. The perfect “has existed” seems impossible to reconstruct with even
a shadow of conﬁdence. As for the past tense, there are several possibilities.
The regular form would of course be ¨
ean¨
e, which form I might well use
myself.
Another possibility is suggested by material published in Vinyar Tengwar
#39, pp. 6–7. Tolkien discusses the sound he represented as ˜
n (= the ng of
king, a sound that in Quenya had been lost between vowels) and how it may
be possible to deduce where it had occurred earlier: “The former presence
of intervocalic ˜
n, later lost in Quenya, could be detected by consideration
of the relations between t¨
ea ‘indicates’ and teng¨
e ‘indicated’, tengwe ‘sign’,
and comparison with ¨
ea ‘exists’ beside engwe ‘thing’.” Tolkien’s point is
that before w, the sound ˜
n had been strengthened to ng, and this combi-
nation was not lost. The Quenya word tengw¨
e “sign” is explicitly said to
represent primitive te˜
n-wˆ
e (VT39:17), and we are clearly to understand that
engw¨
e “thing” likewise comes from e˜
n-wˆ
e, though Tolkien did not explic-
itly mention this primitive form. Thus it can be established that the original
roots are te˜
n- and e˜
n-, respectively, though in the verbs t¨
ea “indicates” and
¨
ea “exists” the ˜
n has been lost because it occurred between vowels: These
words are obviously meant to descend from primitive te˜
nˆ
a, e˜
nˆ
a. What is
310


interesting is that Tolkien also mentioned the form teng¨
e “indicated”. Un-
fortunately, this English gloss is ambiguous. Is this “indicated” as the past
tense of “indicate”, or “indicated” as the passive participle of the same verb?
The Quenya form could be a kind of adjective of similar meaning, since many
Quenya adjectives end in -¨
e. But if teng¨
e “indicated” is to be understood
as the past tense of t¨
ea “indicates”, we must conclude that the past tense
of ¨
ea “exists” should probably be eng¨
e rather than ¨
ean¨
e: Perhaps teng¨
e
is meant to come from te˜
n-nˆ
e – i.e. the root te˜
n- + the past tense marker
-nˆ
e, the combination ˜
nn evolving into a long or double ˜
n˜
n which was not
lost even between vowels, but came out as ng in Quenya. If so, a primitive
past tense e˜
n-nˆ
e “existed” might likewise produce Quenya eng¨
e.
The verb ¨
ea can presumably receive pronominal endings like any other
verb, e.g. ¨
eamm¨
e “we exist”.
20.2
Ma: An interrogative particle?
In the previous lesson, we introduced the words man “who?”, mana “what?”
and manen “how?” They can be used to construct certain kinds of ques-
tions, but the commonest kind of question is not exempliﬁed in published
material: How do we construct the kind of question that may be answered
with a simple “yes” or “no”?
English uses various procedures to get from a simple assertion to a question
about whether something is actually true. Assertions like “it is so” or “he
has come” can be turned into a questions by fronting the verb: “Is it so?”,
“Has he come?” However, in contemporary English, this procedure only
works with a few verbs. An assertion like “he wrote the book” is turned into
a question by adding a form of the verb “to do” at the beginning of the
sentence and turn what used to be the ﬁnite verb into an inﬁnitive: “Did he
write the book?”
Obviously, the simplest way of turning an assertion (a declarative state-
ment) into a question would be to simply slip in some kind of particle
that merely signals, “This is not an assertion that something is so and so,
but a question about whether it is so and so.” Many languages of our own
world do employ such particles (e.g. Polish czy), and this simple and elegant
way of constructing yes/no questions seems to have considerable appeal to
language-constructors as well. Esperanto has the interrogative particle chu
(cxu), apparently based on the Polish word, and the sentence “he wrote the
book” – li skribis la libron – is turned into a question “did he write the
book?” simply by adding chu at the beginning: Chu li skribis la libron?
But what about Quenya? Still clinging to this example, how do we turn
the declarative statement tences i parma “(s)he wrote the book” into a
question? Does Quenya have an interrogative particle we can slip in?
In PM:357, quoted in the previous lesson, Tolkien refers to ma or man
311


as an “Eldarin interrogative element” (PM:357). Man is the Quenya word
for “who”, but may the shortest possible “interrogative element” ma func-
tion as an interrogative particle? Some writers have made this assumption.
It may be noted that one Quenya verb for “ask” is maquet- (past tense
maquent¨
e, PM:403). Since maquet- transparently means “ma-say”, it may
be suspected that in some way or another, Quenya questions often involve
the element ma.
It has come to my knowledge that there is a Tolkien manuscript which
does refer to ma as an interrogative particle. If Tolkien meant a particle
like Polish czy or Esperanto chu, we may apparently turn a declarative
statement into a yes/no question simply by slipping in a ma, most likely at
the beginning of the sentence (no attested examples):
Tences i parma “(S)he wrote the book” > Ma tences i parma? “Did
(s)he write the book?”
N´
ıs enta n´
a Elda “That woman is an Elf” > Ma n´
ıs enta n´
a Elda?
“Is that woman an Elf?”
E¨
a malta i orontess¨
e “[There] is gold in the mountain” > Ma ¨
ea malta
i orontess¨
e? “Is [there] gold in the mountain?”
I n´
er caruva coa “The man is going to build a house” > Ma i n´
er
caruva coa? “Is the man going to build a house?”
Conceivably ma might also be used in so-called dependent questions, with
the force of English “whether”: Umin ista ma ut´
ulies, “I don’t know
whether (s)he has come.” This is speculation, however, and it must be em-
phasized that we have yet to see the interrogative particle ma in any actual
Quenya sentence written by Tolkien. The manuscript in which he refers to
ma as an interrogative particle is apparently quite early, so this particle
may well belong to some variant of “Qenya” rather than the more LotR-
compatible forms of Quenya.
Even assuming that the system I presupposed when constructing the ex-
amples above does indeed correspond to Tolkien’s intentions at some stage,
he may very well have decided upon something else later. Indeed certain
fragments of post-LotR Quenya material includes a word ma of a quite dif-
ferent meaning: it functions as an indeﬁnite pronoun “something, a thing”
(VT42:34). Whether this implies that ma as an interrogative particle had
been abandoned is impossible to say (PM:357 at least conﬁrms that ma as
an interrogative “element” survived into the post-LotR period). Whether
the two ma’s can coexist in the same version of Quenya is a matter of taste,
unless it turns out that Tolkien actually addressed this question in some
manuscript (and I wouldn’t hold my breath). Presently, the system sketched
above is probably the best we can do when it comes to constructing yes/no
questions in Quenya.

20.3
Sa introducing nominal clauses
We have introduced several words that may be translated “that”: the pro-
noun ta and the demonstratives enta and tana (tanya).
There is, however, another kind of “that” as well – very common in any
substantial text. We are talking about “that” as a particle introducing so-
called nominal clauses.
As we know, nouns can take on various functions in a sentence. Very
often they appear as the subject or object of a verb, as when the noun Elda
“Elf” functions as the object of the verb ista- “know” in the sentence istan
Elda “I know an Elf”. Sometimes, however, it is useful to treat an entire
sentence as a noun, so that it can take on noun-like functions in a sentence.
Consider a simple sentence like “you are here”. If we want to treat this
sentence as a noun and slip it into a longer sentence to function as (say) the
object, English may signal the noun-like status of the words “you are here”
by placing the word “that” in front of them: “That you are here”. Now
this entire phrase, a so-called nominal clause, can function as the object
of a verb: “I know that you are here”. It could also be used as the subject
of a sentence, as in “that you are here is good”. (But in the latter case,
English would often prefer to slip in a meaningless dummy-subject “it” at
the beginning of the sentence and place the true subject at the end: “It is
good that you are here.)
What, then, is the Quenya equivalent of “that” as a particle forming such
nominal clauses?
Our sole attestation of this important particle comes from a rather obscure
source. A few years ago, a person who called himself Michael Dawson made a
posting to the Tolkien Internet mailing list. He claimed to be quoting at two
removes from an old Tolkien letter which could not be dated more precisely
than “years” earlier than 1968. It was a Quenya greeting including the words
merin sa haryaly¨
e alass¨
e – which is supposed to mean, literally, “I wish
that you have happiness”. (The initial merin actually appeared as “meriu”
in Dawson’s post; lower-case n and u are often very diﬃcult to distinguish in
Tolkien’s handwriting. “Meriu” would be a quite meaningless form, and the
translation provided settles the matter.) As we see, the word sa is here used
as a particle turning the sentence haryaly¨
e alass¨
e “you have happiness”
into a nominal clause, so that it can function as the object of the verb merin
“I want/wish”.
There are several questionable points here. For one thing, not everyone
is convinced that the “Merin” sentence, as it is often called, is genuine at
all. I am told that various eﬀorts to get in touch with this Michael Dawson
have so far proved futile, and it is somewhat disturbing to notice that his
posting was made on April 1. On the other hand, Carl F. Hostetter (who
has seen nearly all of Tolkien’s linguistic manuscripts) brieﬂy commented on
this sentence in VT41:18 and apparently recognized it as genuine, though
313


he has later speciﬁed that it does not occur in any manuscript he knows
of. The word sa is not inherently implausible; it could mean basically “it”
(related to the ending -s), so that merin sa haryaly¨
e alass¨
e originally
or basically signiﬁes “I wish it [, namely that] you have happiness”. But
of course, even if the word sa is genuine Tolkien, it is impossible to say
what stage of Q(u)enya it belongs to. Assuming that the Merin sentence is
actually written by Tolkien, I would say that it is probably quite early, since
its vocabulary corresponds so well to that of the Etymologies (of the mid-
thirties – notice the use of the verb harya- “have, possess”, otherwise only
attested in Etym). So given the ever-changing nature of Tolkien’s conception,
sa as a particle forming nominal clauses may well have been abandoned by
the time Tolkien published LotR. Yet writers can hardly do without this
important word, and presently sa is our sole alternative.
Accepting sa as a word for this meaning, our example above – “I know
that you are here” – could perhaps be rendered into Quenya something like
istan sa ¨
ealy¨
e sinom¨
e (cf. ista- “to know”, sinom¨
e “in this place; here”
– and above we theorized that ¨
ea rather than n´
a is the word used for “is”
when a certain position is discussed). “That you are here is good” could
presumably likewise be rendered sa ¨
ealy¨
e sinom¨
e n´
a m´
ara. “It is good
that you are here” could correspond to something like n´
a m´
ara sa ¨
ealy¨
e
sinom¨
e (if the verb n´
a “is” can be fronted). In this or any other context,
Quenya would hardly need a dummy-subject like the “it” of the English
sentence, so I would not expect to see n´
as or whatever.
In (slightly archaic) English, a “that”-clause may describe an intention;
here is a Tolkienian example: “The titles that [the Vala Orom¨
e] bore were
many and glorious; but he withheld them at that time, that the Quendi
should not be afraid” (WJ:401; modern idiom would slip in a “so” before
“that”, but the meaning remains the same). It would be interesting to know
whether a Quenya sa-clause can be used in this sense. If not, we do not
really know how to express this meaning in Quenya.
Summary of Lesson Twenty
The verb “to be” is poorly attested in Quenya. N´
a means “is”; it has been
hinted that n´
e is the word for “was”. Possibly, n´
a “is” can receive the
regular pronominal endings to express “I am, you are, he/she/it is” etc.
(if so, it should be shortened to na- before endings including consonant
clusters, and n´
e would likewise become short ne-). This may be a reasonable
assumption, but it should be emphasized that there is little or no evidence
to conﬁrm that this is what Tolkien intended. It may be safer to simply
use independent pronouns and leave out the copula “to be” altogether, as
in certain attested examples. Another verb also translated “is” is ¨
ea, which
more properly means “exists”: it would be used for “is” in contexts discussing
314


the presence, existence or position of something (in the latter case ¨
ea may
connect with a prepositional phrase, as in the attested example i or ily¨
e
mahalmar ¨
ea “[God,] who is above all thrones”). – According to certain
pieces of evidence, Quenya (or at least some variant of “Qenya”) had an
interrogative particle ma. Presumably it can be added (at the beginning?)
of declarative statements to turn them into yes/no questions. – According
to one (possibly dubious) source, the form sa can be used for “that” as a
particle introducing nominal clauses (as in “I know that you are here”, “he
said that this is true”, etc.)
Vocabulary
nert¨
ea “ninth”
quain¨
ea “tenth” (So according to a text on Eldarin numerals published in VT42. This
presupposes another word for “ten” than the form cainen occurring in the Ety-
mologies – perhaps quain¨
e, not attested by itself. Maybe cainen would correspond
to an ordinal “tenth” something like cainenya, and perhaps writers should use ei-
ther cainen/cainenya or quain¨
e7quain¨
ea, but to complete our list of Quenya
ordinals 1st–10th we will use the attested form quain¨
ea here.)

e instead of **istan¨
e; perhaps the
perfect “has known” should similarly be isinti¨
e)
lerta- “can” in the sense of “be allowed to” (English often uses “may” in this
sense; see note below)
NOTE on the Quenya verbs for “can”: As explained in a Tolkien manuscript published
in VT41, at least three Quenya verbs can be used to express the idea of “be able to”.
The verb pol- that we have introduced earlier primarily means to be physically able to
do something (cf. the adjective polda “[physically] strong”, apparently related to this
verb). The verb lerta- means to be allowed to do something, to be free to do something
because there is no prohibition – though in some contexts it may also be interchangeable
315


with pol-. The verb ista- “to know” (pa.t. sint¨
e) may be combined with an inﬁnitive to
express “can” in the sense of “know how to”, referring to intellectual ability. Thus istas
tec¨
e would mean “he can write [because he knows the letters of the alphabet]”. Polis
tec¨
e would be “he can write” in the sense of “he is physically able to write [because his
hands are not paralyzed or tied up or something]”. Lertas tec¨
e would mean “he can
write” in the sense of “he may [= is allowed to] write”.

O. Neht¨

P. Mahalma: In early Exilic Quenya probably C (ach-Laut), but
by the Third Age it had evidently become A (breath-H).
Q. Hell¨

Lesson Two
1.
A. Horses
B. Either just “king”, or “a king” with an indeﬁnite article, depend-
ing on what English grammar demands in the context where the
word occurs.
C. The horse
D. The horses
E. Kings
F. One people under one king.
G. The king and the queen.
H. Maidens
2.
I. Tasari
J. Eldar
K. I arani
L. Lier
M. I rocco nu i tasar.
N. Vend¨
e ar t´

O. I t´
ari ar i vendi.
P. Anar ar Isil (probably not i Anar ar i Isil, since in Quenya the words
denoting these celestial bodies seem to count as proper names, requiring no
deﬁnite article)
Lesson Three
1.
A. (Two) eyes, (natural pair of) eyes.
B. Two eyes (= atta hendi, referring to “two eyes” only casually related, like
two eyes of two diﬀerent persons, one eye from each. The dual form hendu,
on the other hand, refers to a natural pair of eyes.)
318


C. Two trees.
D. Two trees (= atta aldar, referring to any two trees. Aldu, on the other
hand, refers to some kind of closely related pair of trees, like the Two Trees
of Valinor in Tolkien’s mythos.)
E. One man and one woman.
F. The stones.
G. Floors.
H. Mountains.
2.
I. Atta ciryar.
J. Ciryat.
K. Rancu (if the example peu “pair of lips” holds, the dual ending -u rather
than -t is always used in the case of bodyparts occurring in pairs, even where
there is no d or t in the noun)
L. Orontu (since oron “mountain” has the stem oront-, a t turning up in
the word, the dual ending would be -u rather than -t)
M. Andu (ending -u rather than -t because of the d occurring in this word)
N. Aiwet.
O. Atta aiwi.
P. Neri ar nissi.
Lesson Four
1.
A. A black horse.
B. Bright eyes (hendu = a natural pair of eyes)
C. Three dead men.
D. Beautiful birds.
E. A queen is a mighty woman.
F. The mountains are great.
G. Best interpreted “a king [is] mighty”, the copula being left out
and understood, but it could also mean “a mighty king” with
a somewhat unusual word-order (an attributive adjective would
more often come before the noun it describes: taura aran rather
than aran taura).
H. The man and the woman are wise.
Theoretically at least, exercises A, C, and D could also be interpreted
“black [is] a horse”, “bright [are] eyes”, “beautiful [are] birds”, the
copula being left out just as in Exercise G. But when the adjective
319


comes immediately in front of the noun it describes, it must normally
be assumed that it is used attributively and not predicatively. On the
other hand, when the order is noun + adjective, as in G, a copula
“is/are” may well be left out.
2.
I. I ninqu¨

J. Alta cirya.
K. I talan n´

O. Eldar nar vany¨
e.
P. Eldar nar vanya li¨
e. (Notice that here, the adjective agrees in number
with the singular noun li¨
e “a people”, which it describes attributively. It does
not agree with the plural noun “Elves”, as in the previous exercise.)
(In exercises K, M, N, O, P, the copula n´
a/nar may be left out and
understood.)
Lesson Five
1.
A. The woman is laughing.
B. The fattest Dwarf is eating.
C. The queen is watching the king.
D. The greatest mountain is mighty.
E. The man is summoning the most beautiful maiden.
F. The bird is singing.
G. The Dwarves are seizing the four Elves.
H. The mightiest king is wise.

Lesson Six
1.
A. The man read the book.
B. The Dwarves ate.
C. The king summoned the queen.
D. A woman sang.
E. The maidens watched the Elf.
F. The ﬁve horses lay (/?were lying) under the big willow.
G. The stars shone.
H. The Dwarf saw a horse.
As suggested in F, it may be that it is also permissible to translate
Quenya past tenses using the “was/were . . . -ing” construction, e.g.
B) “the Dwarves were eating”, D) “a woman was singing”, F) “the
ﬁve horses were lying”. However, Quenya may well have distinct verb
forms for this meaning. Published material provides no clues in this
matter.
2.
I. Nauco hirn¨

K. I rocco camp¨

race in general)

Lesson Seven
1.
A. Many Dwarves possess treasures.
B. The sun will rise and the birds will sing.
C. Six men will watch (/guard) the gate.
D. Every Man (= non-Elf human) will die.
E. All Men die.
F. A wise man reads many books.
G. Every star shines above the world.
321


H. The Elf seizes the Dwarf.
In A, B, E, F, and G, the aorist tense is used to describe various
“general truths” that are more or less timeless. In H, the aorist is used
to describe a momentary, duration-less action.
2.
I. Ilya Elda ar ilya Atan.
J. I Elda hiruva i Nauco.
K. I rocco cap¨

L. I aran tur¨

P. Enqu¨

In K, the aorist describes a momentary, duration-less action. In L and
N, the aorist (tur¨
e) describes a general characteristic or “habit” of an
individual: the king (always) controls many warriors, the warrior (gen-
erally, habitually) wields a sword. In O, the aorist describes a “general
truth” about lions, contrasting with the present (continuative) tense
in P (m´
atar = “are eating”), describing the ongoing activity of some
particular lions instead.
Lesson Eight
1.
A. The man has found the treasure.
B. The lions have eaten the ﬂesh.
C. The king has summoned the queen.
D. The women have read the book.
E. The evil queen has seized the seven Dwarves.
F. You have written seven books.
G. I have spoken.
H. You have seen it.

Lesson Nine
1.
A. [The] shining moon is rising over the world.
B. The jumping Dwarf fell through the ﬂoor.
C. I can hear a singing maiden.
D. One man wielding one sword will not terrify the eight mighty
warriors.
E. A thrall seizing a mighty man is not wise.
F. The eight lions lying under the trees (a)rose, for the lions wanted
to eat the men.
G. A lion cannot stop eating [/cease to eat] ﬂesh.
H. The terrifying warrior stopped watching [/ceased to watch] the
people, for the warrior was not wise. (Another possible interpretation:
“stopped guarding” instead of “stopped watching”.)

The key to Exercise K (“the maiden did not dare to see the queen”) is
the only possible translation using the vocabulary I have provided to
far, but I cannot say for certain that cen- “to see” can also be used in
the sense “to meet”, which is how an English-speaking person would
normally interpret this word used in such a context. But then “see” =
cen- may of course be used in its most basic sense, so that i vend¨
e
´
um¨
e verya cen¨
e i t´
ari may be interpreted “the maiden did not dare
to look at the queen”.
Lesson Ten
1.
A. I love them deeply.
B. They sing beautifully, like (the) Elves.
C. All nine gates are watched.
D. They want to ﬁnd it swiftly.
323


E. You have two books, and ﬁnally you have read them.
F. I have really [/truly/actually] seen an Elf.
G. The hidden treasure will not be found. (Possibly, the Quenya wording
´
uva hirna would suggest: ”. . . will not have been found”, referring to some
future situation.)
H. They did not want to do it, for seeing it was enough [/suﬃced].
2.
I. Elendient¨

e. (Surely you understood that “have
gone” was to be rendered by the perfect form of the verb lelya-, or did
you start messing with lelyaina or something, desperate to bring
in a separate word for “gone”? No need. . . )

The word order is certainly somewhat ﬂexible; the adverbs in M, N,
and O could probably also follow the verb (e.g. hostanent¨
e lintav¨
e
for “they swiftly gathered”). Cf. my own key to I. But when an object
or an inﬁnitive is to follow, I ﬁnd it slightly awkward to separate it
from the ﬁnite verb by inserting an adverb between them. Of course,
you can always have the adverb at the end of the sentence as well.
Lesson Eleven
1.
A. They found the dead warrior’s sword. (Genitive of former possessor.)
B. The stars of heaven are shining. (Genitive of location: the stars are in
heaven.)
C. I watched the woman’s eyes (dual). (Partitive genitive: the woman’s
eyes are physically part of her.)
D. They shall see the King of Men and (of) all lands. (Genitive de-
scribing the relationship between a ruler and the ruled – people or territory.)
E. A house without ﬂoors is not a real house. (The preposition ´
u “with-
out” is followed by genitive, hence ´
u talamion in Quenya.)
F. The queen’s evil brothers want to rule the peoples of the world.
(I t´
ario ´
umi¨
e torni: genitive of family relationship. Ambaro lier: genitive
of location – the peoples are in the world.)
324


G. The horns of the animals are big. (Partitive genitive, as in Exercise B
above.)
H. The ten lions quickly ate the ﬂesh of the horse. (I rocco hr´
av¨
e “the
horse’s ﬂesh” – genitive of source, the ﬂesh coming from the horse. Notice
that the noun rocco “horse” is unchanged in the genitive singular, since it
ends in -o already.)
2.
I. Menelo aiwi [or, (i) aiwi Menelo] cenuvar cainen ohtari
imb¨
e i alt¨
e s´
ıri. (Menelo aiwi “the birds of heaven” – genitive of loca-
tion.)
J. I arano m´
ol [or, (i) m´
ol i arano] ulyan¨
e limp¨
e mir (i) analta
i yulmaron [or, mir i yulmaron analta]. (I arano m´
ol “the king’s
thrall” – genitive denoting the relationship between the ruler and the ruled,
or various relationships between people in general. Notice ulyan¨
e as the past
tense “poured” in the transitive sense. [I] analta i yulmaron or i yulmaron
analta: “the biggest of the cups”, partitive genitive – the biggest cup being
one of all the cups mentioned. Cf. Tolkien’s elenion ancalma “brightest of
[/among] stars”.)
K. I Eldo toron [or, (i) toron i Eldo] hostan¨
e (i) cainen parmar
elenion.(I Eldo toron “the Elf’s brother”: genitive of family relationship.
Notice that when the genitive ending -o is added to a noun like ending in -a,
like Elda, it displaces this ﬁnal vowel. (I) cainen parmar elenion “the ten
books about stars”: the genitive being used in the sense “about, concerning”.
Perhaps the word order elenion cainen parmar is also possible, but it feels
less natural.)
L. (I) alta s´
ır¨
e i n´
or¨
eo [or, i n´
or¨
eo alta s´
ır¨
e] ull¨
e mir cilya. ([I]
alta s´
ır¨
e i n´
or¨
eo ” the great river of the land” – genitive of location. Notice
ull¨
e as the past tense “poured” in the transitive sense; contrast ulyan¨
e in
Exercise J above.)
M. N´
er ´
u anto um¨
e pol¨
e quet¨
e. (The preposition ´
u is followed by
genitive, but here it the genitive ending is “invisible”, since the noun anto
“mouth” ends in -o already.)
N. Ec´
enien (i) analta ily¨
e orontion nu Menel.(Partitive genitive;
cf. Exercise J above.)
O. Merin hir¨
e n´
or¨
e ´
u alt¨

u is
followed by genitive; hence lamnion here.)
P. Cenuval(y¨
e) laman ´
u rasseto. (Genitive after ´
u; rasseto dual gen-
itive of rass¨
e “horn”.)
Lesson Twelve
1.
A. Both phrases may be rendered “the wine of the Elves”. However,
the genitive phrase i limp¨
e Eldaron implies “the wine coming
325


from the Elves”, sc. wine somehow originating with or obtained
from the Elves. On the other hand, the possessive phrase i limp¨
e
Eldaiva implies “wine owned by the Elves” at the time which is
being considered, irrespective of the origin of the wine.
B. You have (/possess) a cup of gold.(Yulma maltava “cup of gold”:
the possessive-adjectival case used in its “compositive” sense, denoting what
something is made of.)
C. The horse of the Elf [/the Elf’s horse] has fallen into the deep
gorge. (I rocco i Eldava “the Elf’s horse”: possessive case used of current
ownership. One could argue that Tolkienian Elves seem to be so close to their
horses that to them, their steeds are more like family members than posses-
sions, and then it would be more appropriate to use the genitive case: i rocco
i Eldo or i Eldo rocco. But as I said in the Introduction, the “Elves” of
these exercises are not necessarily Tolkienian Elves.)
D. Men of peace will not be warriors. (Neri s´
ereva “men of peace”:
possessive-adjectival case used of a permanent characteristic.)
E. Great walls of stone hid the houses of the ten richest men of the
city. (Rambar ondova “walls of stone”: compositive -va. I coar i cainen
analy¨
e neriva “the houses of the ten richest men”: possessive case used of
current ownership. [neri] i osto “[men] of the city”: genitive of location, the
men being in the city. Notice that the word osto is here inﬂected for genitive,
though the ending -o is invisible since this noun already ends in -o. Cf. also
Exercises L and N below.)
F. The house of the king’s sister [or, the king’s sister’s house] is red.
(In the phrase i coa i arano selerwa, the genitive i arano “the king’s” is
dependent on selerwa “sister’s”, which possessive form in turn points back to
i coa “the house”. The genitive refers to a family relationship, the possessive
to the current ownership of the house. I coa i selerwa i arano, “the house
of the sister of the king”, would be a clearer wording.)
G. One of the thralls has seized the sword of the king. (Min¨
e i m´
olion
“one of the thralls”: partitive genitive; i macil i aranwa “the sword of the
king”: the possessive case used of current ownership. Of course, if the thrall
runs away with the sword of the king, it eventually turns into i macil i arano
instead, the genitive indicating former possession. If the rebellious thrall kills
the king with his own sword, this action would produce the same eﬀect im-
mediately, the king instantly being reduced to a former possessor: I macil
i aranwa enters the king’s chest, i macil i arano comes out through his
back.)
H. The maiden’s brother found all the treasures of the eleven Dwarves
between the four horns of the white mountains. (I vend¨
eo toron
“the maiden’s brother”: genitive of family relationship; i harmar i minqu¨
e
Naucoiva “the treasures of the eleven Dwarves”: possessive case denoting
326


current ownership. I canta rassi i ninqui orontion “the four horns of the
white mountains”, either partitive genitive if the horns are perceived as being
part of the mountains, or genitive of location if the horns are thought of as
being in the mountains.)
2.
I. S´
ıri limpeva uller mir i nero anto [or, mir (i) anto i nero].
(S´
ıri limpeva “rivers of wine”: compositive -va. I nero anto “the man’s
mouth”: partitive genitive, the man’s mouth being part of him. Also notice
uller, not ulyaner, as the intransitive past tense of ulya- “to pour”.)
J. I seldoron seler [or, (i) seler i seldoron] hostan¨
e (i) engwi
i seldoiva ar lend¨
e mir (i) coa i t´
ariva. (The genitive phrase
i seldoron seler “the boy’s sister” refers to a family relationship; the pos-
sessive forms seldoiva and t´
ariva have to do with current ownership of the
“things” and the “house”, respectively.)
K. One possibility: (I) muil¨
e i nissiva varyan¨
e alta harma mal-
tava. (In the phrase harma maltava “treasure of gold”, the -va case is used
in the same sense as in Exercise B above – but “the secrecy of women” can
be rendered in various ways. Using the possessive-adjectival case as suggested
here, it refers to “the secrecy of the women” as a more or less permanent at-
tribute of theirs. But one might also use the genitive, i nission muil¨
e or (i)
muil¨
e i nission, focusing rather on the women’s “secrecy” at the particular
time in the past which is being related. One might even interpret it as a kind
of subject genitive, “the women” being the ones who are secretive and thus
the subjects of the secrecy.)
L. One possibility: I minqu¨
e ohtari ´
umer pol¨
e varya (i) s´
er¨
e
i osto [or, i osto s´
er¨
e], an alta morni¨
e lantan¨
e. (Rendering
“the peace of the city” as i s´
er¨
e i osto, using the genitive case, would focus
on the “peace” of the “city” as its attribute at one speciﬁc time – the peace
emanating from the city, so to speak. Conceivably it could also be interpreted
as a genitive of location, the peace being in the city. Certainly one might
also say (i) s´
er¨
e i ostova, using the possessive case, but then we are rather
talking about peace as a permanent attribute of the city, and the message of
this sentence is that the peace did not prove to be quite permanent after all.
But a Quenya-speaking Mayor, expressing a pious wish “may the peace of the
city last forever”, might well say ostova.)
M. One possibility: Lelyuvant¨
e ter n´
or¨
e alt¨
e aldaiva ar rimb¨
e
ondoiva, an merint¨
e cen¨
e (i) osto i taura ohtarwa. (N´
or¨
e
alt¨
e aldaiva ar rimb¨
e ondoiva “a land of great trees and [of] many rocks”:
the possessive-adjectival case describing characteristic features of the “land”.
(I) osto i taura ohtarwa is the most natural translation of “the city of the
mighty warrior” if we imagine him to be still alive, somehow “owning” the
city where he dwells. But of course we may also be talking about a long-dead
warrior who has brought fame to the city where he once lived, and then it
327


would be more natural to use the genitive case, denoting a former possessor:
(i) osto i taura ohtaro or i taura ohtaro osto. This wording might also
be appropriate if the “warrior” happens to have founded the city in question,
since the genitive case may denote an originator – living or dead.)
N. One possibility: Ramba muil´
eva varyan¨
e (i) nurtaina malta
i osto [or, i osto nurtaina malta], ar ´
umen hiritas. (Ramba
muil´
eva “a wall of secrecy”: the -va case is used in its compositive sense,
the metaphorical wall being “made of” secrecy. Notice the lengthening of the
ﬁnal vowel in muil¨
e “secrecy” when the ending -va is added, as seems to be
characteristic of words with ui in their second-to-last syllable; cf. the attested
example huin´
eva “of gloom”. – If we translate “the hidden gold of the city”
using a genitive as suggested here – (i) nurtaina malta i osto – it would
probably be a genitive of location: the “hidden gold” is in the “city”. But if
we take the word “city” as referring primarily to the people of the city, we
might rather use the possessive case of current ownership: i nurtaina malta
i ostova.)
O. (I) n´

eva, an i Atani i n´
or¨
eo [or, i
n´
or¨
eo Atani] umir hlar¨
e (i) alya lamb¨
e (i) Eldaiva. (Possibly
Eldaiva should here receive the article i in both of its occurrences, since the
reference may not be to “Elves” as a race, but rather to “the” particular
Elves living in a particular country. Anyhow, these possessive forms refer
to current ownership of the land [n´
or¨
e] and the language [lamb¨
e]. In the
phrases n´
or¨
e rimb¨
e vany¨
e engw´
ıva “a land of many beautiful things” and
n´
or¨
e morni´
eva “land of darkness”, the possessive-adjectival case describes
characteristic features of the “land”; cf. Exercise M above. Notice the long
vowels of engw´
ıva and morni´
eva. The former represents earlier engweiva
[engw¨
e + -iva], the diphthong ei later becoming long ´
ı, whereas in morni´
eva
the ﬁnal -¨
e of morni¨
e “darkness” is lengthened because the word ends in two
short syllables. – In the phrase ´
u Eldaron “without Elves”, the preposition
´
u regularly governs the genitive case. – In accordance with Tolkien’s usage in
one late source, one might also use the genitive in the phrase “language of
the Elves”, hence Eldaron instead of Eldaiva, but this would contradict what
Tolkien wrote elsewhere.)
P. I arano sello hostal¨
e parmaiva Eldaron. (I arano sello “the
king’s sister’s”: the ﬁrst genitive refers to a family relationship, but sello
hostal¨
e “sister’s gathering” is an example of subject genitive: the king’s sis-
ter is the subject carrying out the “gathering”. Parmaiva “of books”: the
possessive-adjectival case here takes on the function of object genitive, the
“books” being the objects of the “gathering”. Eldaron “of Elves” or “about
Elves”: the genitive case is used in its most abstract sense of “about” or “con-
cerning”, as in the attested example Quenta Silmarillion = “the Story of
the Silmarils”.)

e lelien = “we
want [in order] to go” would make no sense. On the other hand, the “in order”
test reveals that the verbs lerya- “to free” and anta- “to give” should appear
as gerunds in dative, sc. lerien and antien: “We want to go into the city
[in order] to free all Men and [in order] to give the gold of the king to the
thralls.”)

Lesson Fourteen
1.
A. We (inclusive) will go from the tower to the house. (Alternative
interpretation: “out of the tower”, “into the house”.)
B. All Elves have passed [/disappeared] from the world.
C. The Dwarves have come from [or, out of] the mountains; they
have gone to [or, into] the houses and are drinking our (incl.)
wine.
D. The evil warriors will seize the gold of our (incl.) people [in order]
to send our (incl.) treasures to a remote land.
E. The woman went away from my house and went to the river.
F. The ﬁrst ship will come from the West.
G. One fears the lions [Quenya: ”. . . feels fear from the lions”], for
they have eaten the king of our (exclusive) people, and they will
not go away from our (exclusive) land [or simply: ”. . . will not
leave our land”.] (Since r´
a “lion” has the stem-form r´
av-, and **r´
avllon
is not a possible word, the plural ablative would presumably require a connect-
ing vowel, which is -i- in the case of plural words: Hence we used r´
avillon
as the pl. ablative of r´
a. Also notice liemmo as the genitive of liemma “our
people”.)
H. Nessim¨

my room!”

e Calandil Nessimenna: “Yondolya elendi¨
e [or, oanti¨
e]
et i coallo, an ily¨
e i seldor lender [or, oanter = “went away”]
i ambonna.” (The word et may be omitted, since the simple ablative i
coallo can express “out of the house” by itself – but without et, the ablative
might just as well be interpreted “[away] from the house”.)
J. Menello Anar ant¨
ea cala Ambarelman [dative!], ar i mor-
ni¨

e. (Perhaps Menelello with a connecting vowel -e- would also
be a valid ablative form of Menel. Notice that “to our world” should in this
context be a dative rather than an allative form; cf. Exercise B in Lesson
Thirteen above. But perhaps allative Ambarelmanna would also be possible,
the meaning being: “the Sun is giving [out] light [which is going] to our world”.
The dative and allative cases are closely related; the lay-out of the Plotz letter
330


suggests that the dative in -n may have originated as a shorter variant of the
allative in -nna.)

aranenna, mindonenna. Notice how the ending -nya always prefers -i- as
its connecting vowel where one is required, hence “my thrall” = m´
olinya. On
the other hand, ohtarilyar “your warriors” shows -i-only because the word
is plural, cf. also m´
olimmar “our thralls” in Exercise N below. According to
the system we have tried to make out, the singular forms would be ohtarelya
“your warrior”, m´
olemma “our thrall”. – Possibly “my sons” could also be
expressed as a contracted form yonyar [instead of yondonyar], but yonya
“my son” [LR:61] may primarily be used as a form of address.)

(Since vend¨

Exercise G above. An alternative allative form of laman “animal” might be
lamanna as a contraction of laman-nna [instead of involving the stem-form
lamn-, necessitating the addition of a connecting vowel before -nna can be
added].)

ending -n], formed from toron, torn- “brother” with the connecting vowel -i-
that is preferred by the ending -nya “my”. Perhaps toronya, for toron-nya,
would also be possible [dative toronyan]. Talamenna as the allative of ta-
lan “ﬂoor” takes into account the stem-form talam-, but perhaps talanna
for talan-nna would also be an acceptable form.)

Lesson Fifteen
1.
A. (S)he [or, it] will come on the second day.
B. In the winter[,] many birds go away to dwell in [the] South; after
the winter they go away from [the] South [or, leave the South]
and come to our (incl.) land.
C. His/her ﬁnding gold in the mountains gave joy to his/her people,
for his/her ﬁnding it made his/her people rich.
D. In [the] second winter that (s)he lived in the house[,] (s)he found
a treasure under the ﬂoor.
E. (S)he speaks our tongue, for (s)he dwells (/lives) in our (incl.)
land.
F. (S)he says/said: “I saw a sword in the warrior’s left hand.” (Notice
the shortening of the long vowel of m´
a before a consonant cluster: locative
mass¨
e.)
333


G. The man who found the treasure will hide the things which he has
found in his two-room apartment (. . . if we continue to translate dual
forms of samb¨
e “room” as “two-room apartment”, that is. Notice that the
second i of the Quenya sentence is the relative pronoun “who”, not the article
“the”. The relative pronoun ya “which” here appears in the form yar, a plural
ending being attached, because it refers back to the plural word “things”: We
assume that ya is inﬂected as a noun in -a. This yar should not be confused
with the attested form yar “to whom”, which is not plural but has the old
allative ending -r [as in mir “into”] attached.)
H. On the hill[,] (s)he sees the couple whom (s)he has watched from
his/her house, and to whom (s)he gave his/her gift. (We assume
that the relative pronoun ya would appear with dual endings when referring
to a dual word: yat, dative yant.)

relative pronoun like yallo. But we lack attested examples, of course; perhaps
it should be yallo pol¨
e cen¨
e quen with the subject following the entire verb
phrase. And for all I know, yallo quen pol¨

Lesson Sixteen
1.
A. (S)he has come from the East on a white horse. (Of course, the
instrumental form in -nen does not really mean “on” but implies “by means
of” – the horse being identiﬁed as the means of travel. It is not entirely
obvious how rocconen is best translated in English, so the precise wording
of the translation is unimportant as long as the student clearly grasps the
meaning of the instrumental form itself. One might well translate:
”. . . riding a white horse”, though no element actually meaning
“riding” is present.)
B. The man wounded the lion with a spear, and he said: “Don’t eat
my son!”
C. We (excl.) said to the Elf: “Our (incl.) friendship is renewed by
your gift!”
D. On the third day (s)he said to the maiden: “Do what you want!”
(. . . ya merily¨
e = “[that] which you want”.)
E. One cannot ﬁnd a treasure hidden by Dwarves, for a Dwarf loves
deeply the gold that he possesses.
F. The man is wounded by [the] horns (dual) of the animal; wish
that he will not die! (literally: “be it that he will not die!” Possible, but
rather less probable interpretation: ”. . . that it will not die!” – referring to
the animal! If the ending -s is to cover both “he”, “she” and “it”, one can’t
always be quite certain where the sympathies of the speaker really lie. . . )
G. (S)he is singing with joy(/because of joy).
H. Go to the city and say to the mighty queen: “May you protect our
(incl.) land from the evil warriors!” (Nai varyuvaly¨
e n´
orelma. . . =
literally “be it that you will protect our land. . . ”)
NOTE ON EHT¨
E “SPEAR”: In exercise B, I used ehtenen as the instrumental
form of this noun. In the Etymologies, Tolkien ﬁrst derived this word from ekte,
but according to a note by the editor, a variant reading ekti was also introduced.
If we accept this latter version, so that Quenya eht¨
e “spear” is to be derived from
primitive Elvish ekti, the Quenya word should probably have the stem-form ehti- so
that the instrumental form would be ehtinen rather than ehtenen. But the plural
instrumental form should probably be eht´
ınen (as in Exercise K below) no matter
which “etymology” we prefer, since eht´
ınen could represent both ehti+inen (two
short i’s merging into one long ´
ı) and ehte+inen (ei regularly becoming long ´
ı).

Lesson Seventeen
1.
A. This thing is the sword found by Calandil [the] Tall. (Calandil
Hallanen “by C. [the] Tall”: notice how the case ending for instrumental is
added to the last word of the phrase.)
B. All animals have disappeared from this land (n´
or¨
e sinallo = “from
this land”; again notice how the case ending, here for ablative, is added to
the last word – the demonstrative sina “this”. However, n´
orello sina would
perhaps be equally possible.)
C. A snake wounded his/her right arm, and (s)he said: “Wish that
all snakes will [or, would] die!” (Rancurya = “his [or, her] arm”; notice
how ranco “arm” appears in the form rancu- before endings, since it is a
U-stem. Possibly, the dual “pair of arms” would also have the form rancu,
but if that form were intended here, we would also see the extra dual marker -t
following the ending -rya. Cf. m´
aryat = “her (pair of) hands” in Nam´
ari¨
e.)
D. That night, they found that Dwarf on the hill over there [literally:
on yonder hill]. (L´
om¨
e yanass¨
e = “in that night”, but English would sim-
ply say “that night” in such a context. Yana may signify “that” of something
that existed formerly or in the past, and since the reference is to a night in the
past, this word is appropriate here – if we have reconstructed Tolkien’s inten-
tions correctly! Cf. also hr´
ıv¨
e yanass¨
e ”in/during that winter” in exercise H
below. Nauco tana: “that Dwarf”, the word tana “that” simply focusing on
individual identity. Ambo entass¨
e: “on yonder hill, on the hill over there”:
the word enta apparently means “that” with emphasis on spatial position.)
336


E. The tall ships have passed away north(wards); those ships will
not come to the lands of (the) South. (Ciryar tan¨
e “those ships”: we
surmise that tana “that” can have the plural form tan¨
e “those”, the demon-
strative behaving like an adjective.)
F. On the fourth day, that queen died by [/from] the poison of a
snake. (T´
ari yana: “that queen” of a queen who is dead, yana being used
of something that is past – but “that queen” could probably also be t´
ari tana,
merely focusing on personal identity.)
G. The strong arms of the men from (the) North can seize the spears
from ﬁghting warriors. (Ohtari mahtalallon “from ﬁghting warriors”:
notice how the word ohtari “warriors” receives only the simplest plural end-
ing, normally associated with the nominative case, but the plural ablative end-
ing -llon added to the participle mahtala “ﬁghting” indicates that the whole
phrase is in the ablative case. – The word order mahtala ohtarillon would
be equally possible: Here the ablative ending is added to the noun “warriors”,
since it is now the last word of the phrase.)
H. That winter, they lived (/dwelt) in the fourth house of that road
(/street). (Hr´
ıv¨
e yanass¨
e: locative “during/in that winter”; cf. Exercise
D above. Mall¨
e tano “of that road”, genitive of mall¨
e tana “that road” –
the genitive ending -o displacing a ﬁnal -a as usual.)

as angu- in a compound.)

O. Aur¨

but enta can refer to something that lies in the future, and as is evident from
the phrase “shall see”, the reference is here to a future day.)
P. Aur¨

(Alternatively aur¨
e tanass¨
e again, but yana can refer to something that lies
in the past, and as is evident from the past tense verb “came”, the reference is
here to a day in the past. – In some texts, Tolkien uses t´
ul¨
e rather than tull¨
e
as the past tense “came” [LR:47, SD:246], but tull¨
e is attested elsewhere and
ﬁts the general patterns better. Cf. some forms discussed earlier: vill¨
e ”ﬂew”,
ull¨
e “poured”.)
Insofar as the system of adding case endings to the “last declinable
word” is not necessarily obligatory, the endings could probably be
added to the relevant nouns as well, e.g. malless¨
e tana (or, enta)
rather than mall¨
e tanass¨
e (or, entass¨
e) for “on that road” in Exer-
cise K.

E. The sixth king of the land is wiser than [”wise beyond”] his father
the ﬁfth king.
F. (S)he expanded his/her house, making it [or, that] the biggest
house of the street.
G. You did it for them; you did not do it for us. (Alternatively, “you

“make”.)

not live in it?
B. What can we [inclusive] do?

also be plural: ely¨

if the pronoun is taken as plural; cf. Exercise K above. Notice that the “who”
of the relative sentence “we who came” is translated by means of the relative
pronoun i: The word man denotes a diﬀerent kind of “who”, used in actual
questions.)

Lesson Twenty
1.
A. You [or, emphatic you] are a Dwarf, not an Elf. (Ely¨
e Nauco: the
copula “are” is left out and understood. Perhaps n´
aly¨
e Nauco would have
been a possible alternative, if n´
a can receive pronominal endings.)
B. I saw that the man’s arm was broken.
C. The king was mighty, but the queen was wiser than the king.
D. Did you know that under the house [there] is a hidden treasure?
E. May I leave [literally, go from] this place?
F. Don’t drink, for [there] is poison in your cup!
G. Will they be here on the tenth day when I come [literally, when
I shall come]?
H. We (excl.) know that [there] is a secret room in this house, but
we have not found it, and until we ﬁnd it we shall not know what
is in the room.

I. “I was rich” can be translated in several ways. The “safest” so-
lution would perhaps be to leave out the copula and use an in-
dependent pronoun (ni or iny¨
e) for “I”: Ni alya or iny¨
e alya.
Of course, this may just as well mean “I am rich”, since there
is no tense-marker. If we want to include one, we must use the
not entirely well-attested form n´
e “was”. Assuming that it can re-
ceive pronominal endings, “I was rich” could be rendered n´
en(y¨
e)
alya.

diﬀerence between ista- “can” = “know how to” and pol- “can” = “be phys-
ically able to”: The speaker knows how to read, but is unable to read in the
dark.)
