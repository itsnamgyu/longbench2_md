Five safety rules for working in or on electrical systems
A set of rules, which are summarized in DIN VDE 0105 as the "five safety rules", are defined for 
working in or on electrical systems as a preventative measure against electrical accidents:
1. Isolate
2. Secure against reclosing
3. Verify absence of operating voltage
4. Ground and short-circuit
5. Provide protection against adjacent live parts
These five safety rules must be applied in the above order prior to starting work on an 
electrical system. After completing the work, proceed in the reverse order.
It is assumed that every electrically skilled person is familiar with these rules.
Explanations
1. The isolating distances between live and de-energized parts of the system must vary 
according to the operating voltage that is applied. 
"Isolate" refers to the all-pole disconnection of live parts. 
All-pole disconnection can be achieved, for example, by:
- Switching off the miniature circuit breaker
- Switching the electronic circuit protection device to the OFF position
- Switching off the motor circuit breaker
- Unscrewing fusible links 
- Removing LV HRC fuses
2. The feeder must be locked against inadvertent reconnection to ensure that it remains 
isolated for the duration of the work. This can be achieved, for instance, by locking the motor 
and system circuit breakers in the OFF position or by unscrewing the fuses and using lockable 
elements to prevent them from being reinserted.

3. The de-energized state of the equipment should be verified using suitable test equipment, 
e.g. a 2-pole voltmeter. 1-pole test pins are not suitable for this purpose. The absence of 
power must be established for all poles, phase to phase, and phase to N/PE.
4. Grounding and short-circuiting are only mandatory if the system has a rated voltage greater 
than 1 kV. In this case, the system should always be grounded first and then connected to the 
live parts to be short-circuited.
5. These parts should be covered, or barriers erected around them, to avoid accidental contact 
during the work with adjacent parts that are still live.
2.7
ESD Guidelines
ESD
All electronic devices are equipped with large-scale integrated ICs or components. Due to their 
design, these electronic elements are highly sensitive to overvoltage, and thus to any 
electrostatic discharge.
The acronym ESD has become the established designation for such electrostatic sensitive 
components/devices. This is also the international abbreviation for such devices.
ESD devices are identified by the following symbol:
NOTICE
Electrostatic discharge
ESD devices can be destroyed by voltages well below the threshold of human perception. These 
static voltages develop when you touch a component or electrical connection of a device 
without having drained the static charges present on your body. The damage caused to a device 
by overvoltage is usually not immediately evident and is only noticed after an extended period 
of operation.
Electrostatic charging
Anyone who is not connected to the electrical potential of their surroundings can be 
electrostatically charged.
The diagram below shows the maximum electrostatic voltage which may build up on 
a person coming into contact with the materials specified in the diagram. These values 
correspond to IEC 801-2 specifications.

Basic protective measures against electrostatic discharge
•
Make sure the grounding is good:
When handling electrostatic sensitive devices, ensure that your body, the workplace and 
packaging are grounded. In this way, you can avoid becoming electrostatically charged.
•
Avoid direct contact:
As a general rule, only touch electrostatic sensitive devices when this is unavoidable (e.g. 
during maintenance work). Handle the devices without touching any chip pins or PCB traces. 
In this way, the discharged energy cannot reach or damage sensitive devices.
Discharge your body before taking any necessary measurements on a device. Do so by 
touching grounded metallic parts. Use only grounded measuring instruments.
NOTICE
Functional errors caused by electrostatic charge
When the 3RC7 ILM and the 3RA8 ILF are installed, contact from the side and from below is not 
permitted.

cybersecurity concept. Siemens’ products and solutions constitute one element of such a 
concept.
Customers are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, 
machines and networks. Such systems, machines and components should only be connected 
to an enterprise network or the internet if and to the extent such a connection is necessary 
and only when appropriate security measures (e.g. firewalls and/or network segmentation) 
are in place.
For additional information on industrial cybersecurity measures that may be implemented, 
please visit 
https://www.siemens.com/cybersecurity-industry. 
Siemens’ products and solutions undergo continuous development to make them more 
secure. Siemens strongly recommends that product updates are applied as soon as they are 
available and that the latest product versions are used. Use of product versions that are no 
longer supported, and failure to apply the latest updates may increase customer’s exposure 
to cyber threats.

2.9
Data security in automation
The topic of data security and access protection (security) is becoming more and more important 
in industrial environments. Increased networking of entire industrial plants, vertical integration 
and networking of the levels within a company, and new technologies, such as remote 
maintenance, are resulting in more increased requirements for protection of the industrial plant. 
Security is the generic term for all protection measures:
•
Loss of confidentiality due to unauthorized accessing of data
•
Loss of integrity due to data manipulation
•
Loss of availability due to destruction of data
To provide protection from manipulation in sensitive plant and production networks, it is 
not enough to apply data security solutions for offices to industrial applications without any 
adaptation.
Requirements
The special requirements of communication in an industrial environment (e.g. communication 
in real time) result in additional requirements for security in industrial use:
•
Protection against interaction between automated cells
•
Protection of network segments
•
Protection from unauthorized access
•
Scalability of the security functionality
•
No influence on the network structure

Equipment Manual, 08/2024, A5E50183188002A/RS-AA/001


Threats
Threats can arise from external and internal manipulation. Loss of data security is not always 
caused by deliberate actions.
Internal threats arise due to:
•
Technical faults
•
Operating errors
•
Errors in programs
These internal hazards are compounded by external threats. The external hazards do not 
differ from the known threats in the office environment:
•
Computer viruses and computer worms
•
Trojan horses
•
Unauthorized access
•
Password phishing
Password phishing means attempting to get a user to divulge access data and passwords by 
masquerading as a different identity in an e-mail.
Precautions
The most important precautions against manipulation and loss of data security in an industrial 
environment are:
•
Filtering and verification of data traffic through virtual private networks (VPN). A virtual 
private network is used to exchange private data in a public network (e.g. the Internet). The 
most common VPN technology is IPsec. IPsec is a collection of protocols based on the IP 
protocol at the network layer.
•
Segmentation into protected automation cells. The aim of this concept is to protect devices 
in the network through security modules. A group of protected devices forms a protected 
automation cell. Only security modules in the same group or the device protected by you can 
be interchanged.
•
Authentication (identification) of the networked devices. The security modules identify 
themselves to each other via a secure (encrypted) channel using authentication procedures. 
This prevents access to a protected segment by unauthorized persons from outside.
•
Encryption of the data traffic. The confidentiality of the data is ensured by encrypting the data 
traffic. For this purpose, every security module is given a VPN certificate which includes the 
encryption key.
VDI guidelines on information security in industrial automation
The VDI/VDE Association of German Engineers "Measurement and Automation" has published a 
guideline for implementation of a security architecture in the industrial environment in the VDI 
guideline "VDI/VDE 2182 Sheet 1, IT Security for Industrial Automation - General Model". You will 
find the guideline under "VDI Standards" on the VDI home page: VDI guidelines (http://

2.11
Requirements for switching high-efficiency motors
The increased requirements for protection devices and switchgear when switching high-
efficiency motors are covered by the new utilization category AC‑3e introduced in 
the IEC 60947‑4‑1 product standard.
The utilization category AC‑3e takes into account the higher switch-on characteristic of 
higher efficiency motors. This is reflected, for example, in a higher starting current when 
starting squirrel-cage motors.
All SIRIUS protection devices and switchgear that are subject to the IEC 60947‑4‑1 product 
standard meet the increased requirements in accordance with utilization category AC‑3e and 
are suitable for use with high-efficiency motors.

The specifications for short-circuit protection (fuses, motor starter protectors, or miniature 
circuit breakers) are available for the device connections of the main circuit and the auxiliary 
circuit. In order to ensure a holistic view for the protection of the device connections, the 
manufacturer is obliged to provide all relevant information for short-circuit protection and 
overcurrent protection.
If, for example, device connections for the control supply voltage, the supply voltage, or digital 
inputs/digital outputs are not connected to self-limiting current sources or energy sources, you 
can find the relevant information on the technical data sheet.

Operating principle
•
Control (switching element): 
The 3RC7 ILM can control the 3RT2 contactor using control commands.
•
Protection: 
The 3RC7 ILM opens the 3RT2 contactor automatically depending on the parameterization, 
e.g. in the event of overcurrent, undervoltage, current phase asymmetry, phase failure. 
•
Diagnostics: 
The current measurement and voltage measurement (for High Feature variants) enable a 
detailed diagnostics to be carried out and transmitted to a controller via the ET200 SP 
interface.

Functions

The functions of the 3RC7 ILM with adjustable parameters are divided into 4 groups:
•
Basic configuration (Page 45)
•
Load protection (Page 48)
•
Condition monitoring (Page 54)
•
Miscellaneous (Page 59)
 
For the most common applications, the basic configuration is sufficient:
•
Rated operational current of the load
•
Load type
•
Interlock time
In the standard configuration of the 3RC7 ILM, the correct setting of these three parameters 
ensures that the control function is effective (via commands from the controller), electrical 
values are recorded, and motor protection is guaranteed.
 
Furthermore, the 3RC7 ILM has additional functions (Page 61).

4.2.1
Rated operational current Ie
This parameter is used to set the rated operational current that the feeder (switchgear and 
motor) can carry continuously.
The rated operational current of the motor can usually be read off the motor's nameplate.
The adjustment range depends on the performance class of the 3RC7 ILM.

3-phase operation
In 3-phase operation, you can operate a 3-phase load at the connections of the contactor.
To ensure motor protection, do not connect more than one motor to an intelligent load 
feeder.
In three-phase operation, do not operate several 1-phase motors on one intelligent load 
feeder.
1-phase operation
In 1-phase operation, you can operate a 1-phase asynchronous motor or load at 
the connections of the contactor. The relevant three-pole tripping characteristics (for 
symmetrical load) apply to 1-phase operation. The measured values for the phase currents L2 
and L3 in data set 94 (Page 249) are not displayed in this mode.
Feed in the mains voltage on terminals L1 and L3(N) only and connect the 1-phase motor to 
the terminals T1 and T3 only.
Refer to the connection example in Chapter "Single-phase motor (Page 265)" for this purpose.

4.2.3
Interlock time
The reverse lock time only applies to a change in rotation direction and prevents the rotation 
direction from being changed too quickly (e.g. from clockwise rotation to anticlockwise 
rotation). The rotating mass of a drive should come to a standstill within the reverse lock time 
before the next switching command is executed. The reverse lock time is started when a motor 
OFF command is detected or an "internal trip command" is pending.
Switching on in the same direction of rotation is immediately possible.
The motor cannot be restarted in the opposite rotation direction until the reverse lock time 
has expired.

4.3
Load protection
The factory settings of the load protection parameters cause the system to behave in a similar 
way to a 3RV20 motor starter protector. It is therefore assumed that these parameters do not 
need to be changed in most cases.
4.3.1
Electronic motor overload protection
The motor's temperature is calculated approximately from the measured motor currents, the set 
rated operational current Ie, and the set trip class. From this, it is derived whether the motor is 
overloaded from the point of view of the 3RC7 ILM or whether it is operating within the 
permissible operating range.
CAUTION
Ensuring overload protection
Do not connect more than one motor to one intelligent load feeder to ensure overload 
protection.
Principle of operation
The electronics continuously calculate a model of the thermal load on the motor dependent on 
the operating time and the current load. The motor model charges itself while the motor is 
running. The motor module discharges after the motor is switched off.

After an overload trip of the motor model, the recovery time (cooling time) must be waited 
for before error acknowledgement is possible. If the supply voltage for electronics (PWR) fails, 
the intelligent load feeder can store the remaining cooling time if the relevant parameters 
have been set. When the supply voltage for electronics (PWR) is restored, the remaining 
cooling time elapses before the load can be switched on again.
If you restart the motor within a very short time after switching it off, the motor model may 
not yet be fully discharged. This can result in an extremely fast overload trip after the restart. 
In continuous operation (partially charged motor module), the tripping times are reduced 
depending on the pre-charge.

Parameter
Default setting
Values
Non-volatile tripping status

Yes: 
Non-volatile tripping status means that upon voltage re‐
covery, a motor protection shutdown that occurred before 
the voltage failure is fully restored.
If a motor protection shutdown occurred before the voltage 
failure, the triggered state is fully restored.
The value of a currently running "recovery time" (= cooling 
time of the motor after overload tripping) is saved and re‐
sumed at the appropriate point after voltage recovery.
The current calculation value of the thermal motor model is 
not saved in case of a voltage failure (= no thermal memory 
exists in case of a voltage failure).
No: 
An overload message from the thermal motor model that 
was pending at the time of the voltage failure is lost when 
the power returns.

4.3.2
Current asymmetry
Asymmetrical power consumption can cause damage to the motor. The current asymmetry 
monitoring function monitors the three phase currents and reports a maintenance demand or 
an error when the parameterized limit values are reached. The current asymmetry can be 
displayed via the measured value "Asymmetry" (see also Chapter Process data and data sets 
(Page 241)).
Note
When the motor is switched on, the current asymmetry evaluation is suppressed for 
approx. 0.5 s.

Rotation direction monitoring 
The rotation direction monitoring function detects whether the line phases are arranged in the 
expected direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) at the input of the load feeder; 
this allows the motor rotation direction to be determined before starting (if the wiring between 
the motor and the load feeder is correct). 
If the rotation direction is incorrect, an error message "Mains rotation direction error" is 
generated and the device does not permit the contactor to close, or if it is closed, it is 
opened.

Starting time monitoring
The starting time of a mechanical application depends on both the motor and the associated 
mechanical system. Typically, this starting time is constant, i.e. each start of the application 
normally takes almost the same amount of time. If an anomaly occurs in an application, this can 
affect the starting time.

Reaction to communication loss
In the event of a communication failure, two parameters can be used to define different 
reactions for the 3RC7 ILM:
Parameter
Default setting
Values
Response to CPU/Master STOP
Substitute value
Switch substitute value: 
The response is defined by the substitute value pa‐
rameter.
Keep last value: 
The load feeder retains the last value. If the load was 
activated, it remains activated; if it was deactivated, 
it remains deactivated.
Substitute value
Switch off load
Switch off load: 
The contactor is switched off automatically.
Note
If the value "Keep last value" is selected for the parameter "Response to CPU/Master STOP", a 
running motor will not be switched off if communication fails. 
It can only be switched off by restarting communication (and setting the corresponding control 
bits) or by disconnecting the supply voltage for the electronics (PWR) or the contactor control 
(AUX-PWR).
Note
If the value "Keep last value" is selected for the parameter "Response to CPU/Master STOP", the 
motor may briefly stop during the restart of communication when the motor is running. To 
prevent this, the corresponding control bits must be set in the PLC/control in OB100.
Substitute values
By default, any loss of communication between the PLC (CPU) and the 3RC7 ILM causes the 
device to stop operating by opening the switching device.
It is possible to set manual operation if communication fails or the PLC is in the stop state.

4.6.2
Current measurement (load current)
The actual current at the device is reported back via the process image for analysis purposes. 
You can read the actual current on each phase directly in the cyclic process image in floating-
point notation (unit: amperes), so no data conversion is required.
Measurement accuracy is ±5%.
 
Requirements:
•
Line frequency: 45 to 65 Hz
•
Measuring range: Lower value of the current setting range up to four times the upper value 
of the current setting range
Example: 
Current setting range 1.2 to 12 A
Lower value of the current setting range: 1.2 A
Upper value of the current setting range: 12 A
Four times the upper value of the current setting range: 4 x 12 A = 48 A

Supply voltage monitoring
4.6.5.1
Supply voltage monitoring for electronics (PWR)
The rated value of the supply voltage is 24 V DC.
To ensure that the 3RC7 ILM operates correctly, the supply voltage monitoring for electronics 
(PWR) is monitored for undervoltage.
If the voltage drops below a limit of 20.4 V, an error message is issued (data set 92, bit 16.7 
"Electronics supply voltage too low").
Note
If a contactor is switched on, it is switched off.
4.6.5.2
Auxiliary voltage monitoring for the switching element (AUX-PWR)
The rated value of the auxiliary voltage is 24 V DC.
To ensure that the contactor operates correctly, the auxiliary voltage for the switching 
element (AUX-PWR) is monitored for undervoltage.
If the voltage falls below a limit of 20.4 V, an error message "Supply voltage switching 
element missing" is generated.
Note
If a contactor is switched on, it is switched off.

If the device is operated in a range between 0.4 and 1.6 A and the cos phi is < 0.9, the 
accuracy of the power values is ±20%.
4.6.7
Device temperature measurement
The 3RC7 ILM provides the temperature of an internal measuring point as measured value.
The measured value can be read out in data set 94. This makes it possible to compare the 
temperature between the load feeders.
If the measured value is 95 °C, a warning message is issued in data set 92 (Page 245).
4.6.8
Statistics
The 3RC7 ILM has internal statistics:
•
Number of error shutdowns (can be reset to 0): This value represents the total number of 
internal trips of the load feeder, regardless of the reason.
•
Number of motor overload trips: This value represents the total number of motor overload 
trips of the load feeder.
•
Operating hours - motor (can be reset to 0): This value summarizes the number of operating 
hours of the load.
•
Operating hours - 3RC7 ILM: This value summarizes the number of operating hours of the 
3RC7 ILM.
The value "Operating hours - motor" can be set via data set 3.
4.6.9
Emergency start
Description
Emergency start enables restart despite an internal trip command. Emergency start is possible 
if there is an ON switching command for the motor. The motor is switched on despite a pending 
trip cause.
Emergency starting is not possible in the following situations:
•
If a device fault is active
•
If the 24 V DC supply voltage (PWR and/or AUX PWR) is missing or if the supply voltage is 
outside the specified range.
•
The blocking protection has responded
•
If a process image error is active

Trip Reset acknowledges all the error messages that are currently active and that can be 
acknowledged. An error message can be acknowledged when the cause of the error has been 
eliminated or no longer exists.
Trip Reset is triggered by:
•
Remote reset via PLC (PIQ bit 0.3 Trip Reset)
•
Reset button on 3RC7 ILM
•
Power-On Reset (switching off and on again of the 24 V DC supply voltages on the device)
4.6.11
Cold start
Description
The "Cold Start" function enables activation of the 3RC7 ILM without mains voltage. The 
3RC7 ILM responds in this case as if the mains voltage were connected to the system. The error 
message "Residual current detection/tripping" is suppressed. Thus, in the commissioning phase, 
for example, the relevant control commands are accepted from the controller and the relevant 
messages are sent.
"Cold start" is activated by setting bit 0.7 in the PIQ and additionally setting the control bits 
for "Motor CW / Motor CCW" (PIQ bit 0.0 / PIQ bit 0.1).
Note
If the "cold start" is activated, no mains voltage may be applied to the device. If the mains voltage 
is applied despite this, an internal trip command and the message "Cold start tripping" are 
generated.

WARNING
Risk of impermissible system states
The CPU switches to STOP mode or the interface module to "station failure" as a result of the 
firmware update being installed. STOP or station failure due to a firmware update can cause an 
unpredictable intelligent load feeder state. After completion of the update, the current PIO and 
the input actions take effect again.
Unexpected operation of a process or a machine can lead to fatal or severe injuries and/or to 
property damage.
Before installing the firmware update, ensure that the intelligent load feeder, the CPU and the 
interface module are not executing an active process.
More options for the firmware update

7.1
Parameter assignment
When configuring (e.g. via the TIA Portal) a 3RC7 ILM, the complete parameterization is set and 
automatically transferred to the 3RC7 ILM. When parameterizing in the user program, the 
parameters are transferred to the module via the data sets with the statement "WRREC". If the 
CPU initiates a new parameter assignment, e.g. if communication breaks down, the 
parameterization is overwritten by the system parameterization via the user program.
The complete system parameterization (hardware configuration) of the 3RC7 ILM is 
supported by the interface modules of the ET 200SP distributed I/O system.
Note
List of supported interface modules and central processing units
The list of supported interface modules and central processing units can be found in 
Chapter Connection of the SIRIUS 3RC7 ILM to the ET 200SP (Page 25).
Note
Trip Reset
When you send valid parameters to the 3RC7 ILM, a Trip Reset is triggered. Acknowledgeable 
active faults are deleted.
Parameters for 3RC7 ILM
When you assign parameters in the user program, transfer the parameters to the module via the 
data sets with the "WRREC" statement.
The parameters that can be set can be found in the DS131 General Parameters 1 (Page 252) 
and DS132 General Parameters 2 (Page 256).
You will find an explanation of the parameters in Chapter Declaration of parameters 
(Page 209).
Note
Changing the parameters during operation
If parameters are modified during operation, they will be overwritten by the parameters 
configured in the hardware configuration during a restart of the control system.

7.2
Commissioning
PRONETA supports you in commissioning the 3RC7 ILM. This PC-based tool enables analysis and 
configuration tasks in networks – without a PLC. The IO test enables quick and user-friendly 
checking and documentation of the wiring of a system.
7.3
Parameterization with a GSD and MDD
A GSDML file is available for the ET 200SP system. This can be used to fully integrate the 3RC7 
ILM into the system with all parameters and to configure it.
The 3RC ILM can also be configured via an MDD (TIA Portal V19 or higher).
7.4
Slot rules
You can find more information on the structure of a system with a 3RC7 ILM in the ET 200SP 
System Manual (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/58649293).
7.5
Data plausibility check
Checking incoming parameters
The intelligent load feeder checks all incoming parameters for validity and plausibility. The valid 
parameters are stored in data set 131 (Page 252) and data set 132 (Page 256).
In the case of incorrect parameters during startup (startup data sets after power ON of the 
3RC7 ILM):
•
The diagnoses "Group fault" and "Invalid parameter value" are set in the DS92 device 
diagnostics (Page 245).
•
The motor remains shut down.
•
The currently valid parameter values are retained and can be read via the data sets 131 
(Page 252) and 132 (Page 256). 
In the case of incorrect parameters from the user program and when the motor is switched 
off:
•
The diagnoses "Group warning" and "Invalid parameter value" are entered in the DS92 device 
diagnostics (Page 245).
•
The currently valid parameter values are retained and can be read via the data sets 131 
(Page 252) and 132 (Page 256).
For parameterization when the motor is running:
•
The parameters are not accepted by the starter.
•
The maintenance alarm "Parameters cannot be changed in ON state" is set.
•
The diagnoses "Group warning" and "Invalid parameter value" are entered in the DS92 device 
diagnostics (Page 245).

Declaration of parameters
Rated operational current Ie
This parameter defines the current that the feeder (switchgear and motor) can carry 
continuously. The setting range depends on the relevant device's rating class.
Rated mains voltage
This parameter defines the voltage at which the equipment (e.g. motor) can be operated 
continuously without problems. The setting range depends on the respective equipment.
Load type
This parameter defines whether the intelligent load feeder is to protect a 1-phase or 3-phase 
load.
Non-volatile tripping status
This parameter determines how the thermal motor model should behave when the supply 
voltage monitoring for electronics (PWR) fails.
Thermal motor model (response to overload)
You use this device parameter to determine how the 3RC7 ILM is to respond to overload.
You can find more information in Chapter Electronic motor overload protection (Page 48).
Permissible main power rotation
This parameter defines whether the main power rotation is to be monitored. If the rotation is 
monitored, then the direction of rotation can be selected as "CW" or "CCW".
Trip class
The trip class (CLASS) specifies the maximum time within which a protective device must trip 
from a cold state at 7.2 times the current setting value (motor protection according to 
IEC 60947).
You can find more information in Chapter Electronic motor overload protection (Page 48).

Recovery time
This parameter defines the time after which an overload (thermal motor model) can be 
acknowledged.
Response to supply voltage switching element missing
This parameter defines the behavior of the device in the event of a supply voltage failure of the 
switching elements (AUX-PWR). This parameter is permanently set to group error and cannot be 
changed.
Asymmetry limit error 
This parameter can be used to specify an error limit value for the current asymmetry of the motor 
current in percent. If the limit value is exceeded, the motor is switched off. At a limit value of 0%, 
the function is deactivated.
Asymmetry limit - Maintenance demanded
This parameter can be used to specify a warning threshold for the current asymmetry of the 
motor current in percent. When the limit value is exceeded, the message "Maintenance demand" 
is set. At a limit value of 0%, the function is deactivated.
Mains voltage operating range
This parameter can be used to specify a limit value for mains voltage monitoring in percent. 
Possible are ±10% / ± 20% and ± 30%. At a limit value of 0%, the function is deactivated.
Reset mode at faulty main voltage
This parameter determines how an error in the mains voltage monitoring must be 
acknowledged.
Interlock time
This parameter defines the time that the contactors wait before switching from one direction of 
rotation to the other. Only applies for reversing starters.
Response to CPU/Master STOP
Defines the behavior of the module in the event of a CPU STOP or a communication failure.
Substitute value
This parameter specifies the value to be used in the event of a control failure (including CPU/
Master STOP). This value affects the process image output.

Group diagnostics
This parameter determines whether or not an "automatic message" is to be sent via the 
communication system in the event of error messages and maintenance demanded messages. 
Motor heating limit – maintenance demanded
The 3RC7 ILM warns when the motor temperature rise limit is exceeded. You use this parameter 
to preset a motor heating value in percent as a warning limit. At a set warning limit of 0%, the 
function is deactivated.
Emergency start
This parameter can be used to enable or disable an emergency start or essential service mode. 
The parameter is set to "manual lock/unlock" and cannot be changed.
Preset starting time
This parameter defines the time after which a motor startup should be completed.
Starting time limit - error
This parameter can be used to specify an error limit value for the target starting time in percent. 
If the limit value is exceeded, the motor is switched off. At a limit value of 0%, the function is 
deactivated.
Starting time limit - maintenance demand
This parameter can be used to specify a warning threshold for the target starting time in percent. 
When the limit value is exceeded, the message "Maintenance demand" is set. At a limit value of 
0%, the function is deactivated.
Current upper limit - error
This parameter can be used to specify an error limit value for the motor current in percent. If the 
limit value is exceeded, the motor is switched off. At a limit value of 0%, monitoring is 
deactivated.
Current upper limit - maintenance demanded
This parameter can be used to specify a warning threshold for the motor current in percent. 
When the limit value is exceeded, the message "Maintenance demand" is set. At a limit value of 
0%, monitoring is deactivated.
Current lower limit - error
This parameter can be used to specify an error limit value for the motor current in percent. If the 
limit value is undershot, the motor is switched off. At a limit value of 0%, monitoring is 
deactivated.

Current lower limit - maintenance demanded
This parameter can be used to specify a warning threshold for the motor current in percent. 
When the limit value is undershot, the message "Maintenance demanded" is set. At a limit value 
of 0%, monitoring is deactivated.
Prospective locked rotor current (blocking current)
If the blocking current is exceeded, the intelligent load feeder recognizes blocking.
You can find more information in Chapter Prospective locked rotor current (blocking current) 
(Page 56).
Prospective locked rotor time
The blocking time is the time a motor block can be permitted without tripping the motor. After 
the blocking time has elapsed and blocking is still present, the intelligent load feeder switches 
off.

Configuration 
The 3RC7 ILM is recognized by the ET200SP interface like any other standard I/O module. This 
means that no configuration is required for the device to communicate, only the slot position 
needs to be configured. If the device is replaced (with the same article number or a compatible 
3RC7 ILM), the 3RC7 ILM automatically connects to the automation system. The 3RC7 ILM is a 
part of the automation system. The connection effort is minimal.
You can find more information on the structure of ATEX applications in Chapter Applications 
(Page 30).

9.2
Overview
The 3RC7 ILM has two types of alarm: the warning message/maintenance alarm on the one hand 
and the error on the other:
•
The warning message (related to protective functions) and the maintenance alarm (related 
to status monitoring functions) do not cause the 3RC7 ILM functions to fail, but they do cause 
the MT LED to light up.
•
The alarms output as errors cause the load feeder to stop and the ERROR LED to light up.
•
You can read out the diagnostic messages in the diagnostic buffer of the CPU, for example. 
The maintenance alarms are read out in data set 92 of the 3RC7 ILM.
Note
For general notes on expanded maintenance, see "Diagnostics" in the Function Manual for 
SIMATIC PROFINET (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/view/49948856).
The PROFINET interfaces of the interface module support the diagnostics concept and 
maintenance concept in PROFINET according to the standard IEC 61158-6-10. The aim is 
early detection and correction of potential faults. 
The maintenance information is generated in STEP 7 with the following system events: 
•
Maintenance demanded: Indicated by a yellow screwdriver.
•
Faults: Indicated by a red screwdriver.

The 3RC7 ILM is easy to maintain and can be easily replaced:
•
Replacing the electronics without a PC: The entire configuration of the 3RC7 ILM takes place 
directly on the PLC. This means that no PC or hardware is required to set up the device when 
replacing a part or the electronics. By simply connecting the module and without restarting 
the ET200SP IM or the PLC, the device is recognized and the configuration is loaded from the 
PLC.
•
3RC7 ILM Communication Cable: Siemens offers cables in different lengths (see 
Chapter Accessories for 3RC7 ILM and 3RA8 ILF (Page 42)). 
You can find more information in Chapter Intelligent load feeders for self-assembly with a 
3RC7 ILM (Page 36).
•
Motor starter protector: The recommended 3RV23 motor starter protector only trips in the 
event of a short-circuit. In the event of an overload on the load feeder, the 3RC7 ILM trips and 
the alarm is displayed directly on the PLC
When selecting the motor starter protector, attention must be paid to the short-circuit 
strength with respect to wiring short-circuits and the selectivity of the control cabinet. 
You can find more information in Chapter Intelligent load feeders for self-assembly with a 
3RC7 ILM (Page 36).
•
3RC7 ILM Power Cable: 3RC7 ILM is an optional cable that can be used to reduce the wiring 
effort in the case of side-by-side design of the load feeders. It carries the 24 V DC required to 
power the electronics of the 3RC7 ILM and to close the contactors. If a replacement is not 
available for these lines in the event of a defect, an external wiring of the 24 V DC of the 
electronics and the auxiliary current can always be carried out directly from the terminal of 
one load feeder to the next feeder in an emergency.
You can find more information in Chapter Accessories for 3RC7 ILM and 3RA8 ILF (Page 42).
9.3
Replacing parts of the load feeder
9.3.1
Replacing the 3RC7 ILM Communication Cable (3RC7940-0TE..)
When the defective 3RC7 ILM Communication Cable is replaced, the downstream 3RC7 ILMs are 
disconnected from the communication (see function Reaction to communication loss 
(Page 59)).
After replacement of the defective 3RC7 ILM Communication Cable, communication of the 
devices is automatically restored.
For more information on replacing the 3RC7 ILM Communication Cable, see Chapter 
Connecting and disconnecting 3RC7 ILM Communication Cable (Page 197).

10.4
Interrupts
The 3RC7 ILM has two types of alarm:
•
warning message/maintenance demanded
•
error message
With a warning message or maintenance request, the MT LED on the module was activated. 
These messages do not stop the normal operation of the device. The aim of this type of 
message is to enable maintenance to eliminate the problem before it can no longer be 
handled by the system and an error message is issued.
In the case of an error message, the device is stopped by opening the contactor and the ER 
LED is activated.
These messages are all displayed in the controller's alarm system. In the case of SIMATIC, this 
is displayed in the PLC HMI or directly on an external HMI.
The alarms are generated in TIA Portal with the following system alarms:

Equipment Manual, 08/2024, A5E50183188002A/RS-AA/001
13.4 
Starting datasets 
The starting datasets are data set 131 (Page 252) and data set 132 (Page 256). The 
parameters for this are permanently set to the following values in GSDML and MDD: 
•
Waiting for starting datasets: Yes
This fixed value parameter specifies that the program always waits for starting datasets. The 
fixed value parameter cannot be changed. 
•
Wait time for starting datasets: 180 s
This parameter defines the time for which the device should wait for starting datasets. Once 
this wait time has expired, a group error is generated. 
If the 3RC7 ILM has not yet received any starting datasets, the PIQ is ignored. The device does 
not respond to a switch-on command and runs with the stored parameters or default 
parameters. If no starting datasets are available after the wait time has expired, a group error 
is sent (data set 92, bit 18.4 "No external start parameters received").

Types of coordination 
Standard DIN EN 60947-4-1 (VDE 0660 Part 102) or IEC 60947-4-1 distinguishes between two 
types of coordination (type of coordination), which are referred to as coordination type "1" and 
coordination type "2". In the case of both types of coordination, the short-circuit is reliably 
mastered. the only differences are in the extent of the damage sustained by the device following 
a short circuit.
Type of coordination 1
The load feeder may be non-operational after a short circuit has been cleared. Damage to the 
contactor and the overload release is also permissible.
Type of coordination 2
After short-circuit disconnection, there must be no damage to the overload release or to any 
other part. The load feeder can resume operation without needing to be renewed. Welding of 
the contactor contacts only is permitted if these can be separated easily without significant 
deformation.
