Abstract
Background: Bullying victimization is highly prevalent among sexual minority youths, particularly in educational settings,
negatively affecting their mental health. However, previous studies have scarcely explored the symptomatic relationships among
anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among sexual minority youths who experienced bullying on college
campuses.
Objective: The objectives of our study were to (1) characterize the anxiety-depression-PTSD network structures of gay or
lesbian, bisexuals, and other sexual minority youths previously bullied on college campuses; and (2) compare symptomatic
associations in the anxiety-depression-PTSD networks among bullied sexual minority youths and heterosexual youths’ groups.
Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited college participants from Jilin Province, China. Data were analyzed using a subset
of the data extracted after screening for sexual orientation and history of bullying victimization. Sexual minority youths were
then divided into 3 subgroups: gay or lesbian (homosexual), bisexual, and other. Mental health symptom severity was assessed
using scales: the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale measuring anxiety, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire measuring
depression, and the 10-item Trauma Screening Questionnaire measuring PTSD symptoms. Combining the undirected and Bayesian
network analyses, the anxiety-depression-PTSD networks were compared among sexual minority youths subgroups, and the
difference between heterosexual youths and sexual minority youths was investigated. Chi-square tests were used to compare the
difference in categorical variables, while independent-sample t tests were run on continuous variables.
Results: In this large-scale sample of 89,342 participants, 12,249 identified as sexual minority youths, of which 1603 (13.1%,
95% CI 12.5%-13.7%) reported being bullied on college campuses in the past year. According to the expected influence (EI) and
bridge expected influence (bEI) index, in the global network structure of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, sad mood (EI=1.078,
bEI=0.635) and irritability (EI=1.077, bEI=0.954) were identified as central and bridge symptoms; emotional cue reactivity
(EI=1.015) was a central symptom of PTSD in this global network. In the anxiety-depression-PTSD Bayesian network, anhedonia
had the highest prediction priority for activating other symptoms; and feeling afraid linked symptoms from anxiety to the PTSD
community. Compared to their heterosexual counterparts, sexual minority youths exhibited a stronger association between

difficulty concentrating and appetite. The “sad mood-appetite” edge was strongest in the gay or lesbian network; the
“irritability-exaggerated startle response” edge was strongest in the bisexual network.
Conclusions: For the first time, this study identified the most central and bridge symptoms (sad mood and irritability) within
the depression-anxiety-PTSD network of sexual minority youths with past bullying-victim experiences on college campuses.
Emotional cue reactivity, anhedonia, and feeling afraid were other vital symptoms in the comorbid network. Symptomatic
relationships existed showing heterogeneity in bullied heterosexual youths and sexual minority youth networks, which also was
present within the sexual minority youth subgroups. Consequently, refined targeted interventions are required to relieve anxiety,
depression, and PTSD symptoms.

Introduction
Bullying is defined as the intent or behavior that seeks to harm
another person repeatedly, with an imbalance of power [1,2].
It is reported in the literature that the rate of bullying in higher
education (on college or university campuses) varies across
cultures, ranging from 1.7% to 25.2% [3-5]. Particularly, sexual
minority youths, who identify their sexual orientations as
nonheterosexual, such as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, are vulnerable
to discrimination and bullying [5,6], and have higher odds of
experiencing bullying on campus than their heterosexual
counterparts [7-10]. A national survey in the United States
further reported that sexual minority youths experience a high
rate of verbal harassment (76.1%), sexual harassment (53.7%),
physical harassment (31.2%), and physical assault (12.5%) [11].
In addition, after being bullied, sexual minority youths may
experience adverse physical health and persistent negative
effects on their mental health [12].
A considerable amount of literature has reported that sexual
minority youths exhibit higher rates of anxiety, depression, and
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than their heterosexual
counterparts [13-16]. As a recent meta-analysis noted [17],
compared to heterosexual counterparts, lesbian or gay, as well
as bisexual individuals yielded a higher risk of anxiety and
depression. In addition, sexual minority individuals were found
to be vulnerable to adverse experiences, such as being harassed
and even bullied in school, increasing the risk for anxiety,
depression, and PTSD than those participants who have not
experienced adverse life events [18].
Past research has found differences in mental health problems
among subgroups of sexual minorities [17,19]. For example,
the result from a longitudinal study suggests that bullying
victimization is connected to stronger depressive symptoms
among bisexual women, and stronger anxiety symptoms among
bisexual men [20]. Bisexual individuals are also more likely to
report PTSD than their gay or lesbian counterparts [21].
Pansexual women appear to be more open about their sexuality
but with a higher consciousness in regard to their sexual
orientation-based stigma than bisexual women, which is linked
to poorer mental health [22]. Further, asexual men are suggested
to have higher scores of depression and psychiatric disturbance
than their homosexual and bisexual counterparts [23]. The above
studies show a high heterogeneity of mental health outcomes
among sexual minority subgroups. However, whether these
differences remain consistent among sexual minority youths
who are being bullied on college campuses requires further
exploration.
Minority stress theory provides a conceptual model that the
mental health issues of sexual minorities are partially derived
from minority stressors, which are defined as the excess stress
to which individuals from stigmatized social categories are
exposed to due to their minority position [24], such as higher
rates of bullying and discrimination. Furthermore, minority
stress can cause biological responses that are related to mental
health symptoms [25]. For example, exposure to general
minority stress can affect one’s gene expression, which is
connected to cardiovascular function [26] and exerts an
interactional effect between anxiety, depression, and PTSD
[27-29]. Meanwhile, it may increase the dysregulation of the
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, directly adding to the risk
of depression, anxiety, and PTSD [30,31]. Nevertheless, the
symptomatic relationship between anxiety, depression, and
PTSD among sexual minority youths who are bullied on college
campuses lacks investigation.
In recent years, several published studies have adopted network
analysis in both clinical psychology or psychiatric fields to
explore the relationship between symptoms of various disorders
[32-34]. The undirected network analysis depicts the interactions
between individual symptoms, with a symptom being termed
a “node,” and the partial correlation coefficient between 2 nodes
determining their “edge” [35]. According to the expected
influence (EI) index and the bridge expected influence (bEI)
index, the central and bridge symptoms of the network structure
could be identified, respectively [36,37]. Furthermore, in this
study, Bayesian network analysis was applied to clarify the
directed relationship between symptoms further. Based on the
completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG), Bayesian
network analysis can unclose the putative directions of the
potential causal relationship between 2 nodes [38], and it could
help to discover activating paths among symptoms of anxiety,
depression, and PTSD network [33].
Given these premises, this study was implemented using
undirected and Bayesian network analyses to achieve 2 main
objectives: first, to characterize the symptomatic relationships
in the anxiety-depression-PTSD network among bullied sexual

minority youths and sexual minority youth subgroups; second,
to compare the network structures among bullied sexual minority
youth subgroups. For aim 1, based on previous results
[34,39,40], the researchers hypothesized that depressive and
anxious symptoms would be the most central and bridge among
all symptoms. For aim 2, considering sexual minority youth
subgroups have various prevalence and symptomatic
manifestations of anxiety, depression, and PTSD [14,21], the
researchers hypothesized that different strengths of symptomatic
associations would exist among sexual minority youth subgroups
who had disclosed experiences of being bullied. In addition,
the researchers aimed to enrich the field, as well as help offer
targeted suggestions and interventions for specific symptoms
associated with poor mental health.
Methods
Participants and Settings
This study was designed with a cross-sectional approach,
recruiting College students from 63 Universities or Colleges in
Jilin Province, China, from October to November 2021. Students
completed an electronic questionnaire with a Quick Response
code, delivered by their teachers with their classmates. The
inclusion criteria for recruitment were (1) being 15 years old or
older; (2) studying at universities or colleges in Jilin Province,
China; (3) understanding the Chinese questionnaire and having
the ability to provide informed consent.
Ethical Considerations
Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Ethics
Committee of Jilin University (NO20210929 [11 October
2021]), following the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its
amendments in 2013. Electronic informed consent was provided
by all participants, with consent that their answers could be
applied to any secondary analyses.
Measurements
Participants’sexual orientation was measured by a single-option
question with 6 items: “Which of the following better describes
your sexual orientation?” Except for heterosexuality, all other
sexual orientations are combined to form the sexual minority
youth group [41,42], which was then further divided into 3
subgroups, including homosexuality (gay or lesbian),
bisexuality, and others (asexuality, pansexuality, and uncertain).
Anxiety was measured by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety
Disorder Questionnaire [43], depression by the 9-item Patient
Health Questionnaire [44], and PTSD by the 10-item Trauma
Screening Questionnaire [45]. The experience of being bullied
during higher education was measured by a single question:
“Have you ever been bullied on campus in the past year?”
Details of measurements are presented in the Section S1 in
Multimedia Appendix 1, Additional information for networks.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive Analysis
In total, 117,769 participants were recruited and 89,342 were
included according to the criteria and completion of the
questionnaire. A descriptive analysis was run on the subdata
extracted from screening for sexual orientation and history of
bullying victimization. In the data set of those who had been
bullied on college campuses in the past, they were divided into
groups of heterosexual and sexual minority youth groups.
Sociodemographic variables included participants’ age, sex,
residence, ethnicity, family type, current annual income, and
whether they were an only child. The categorical variables in
heterosexual or sexual minority youth groups were compared
by chi-square tests, while continuous variables were compared
by two-tailed independent-sample t tests.
Undirected Network Estimation
This study used R programming [46] to structure the undirected
network, with the R package “qgraph” (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing) to visualize the Graphical Gaussian
Model [35]. The R package “mgm” assessed the predictability
of a node, referring to the variance of a node that could be
explained by all others [47]. The differences between the sexual
minority youths and heterosexual network structures and among
sexual minority youth subgroups were compared using the R
package “Network Comparison Test” with 1000 permutations
[48]. For more detail on the method, see Section S2 in
Multimedia Appendix 1, Additional information for networks.
Bayesian Network Estimation
In this study, DAG was modelled by the R package “bnlearn,”
with the hill-climbing algorithm [49]. To further obtain a clear
direction among symptoms, the Markov equivalence classes of
the DAG were drawn, which can be described uniquely by a
CPDAG [50]. In CPDAG, all arrows of undirected edges can
be invertible, while all directed edges cannot be converted into
undirected edges. Finally, in the determined CPDAG, the direct
activating paths in the Bayesian network are more conclusive.
More details are shown in Section S2 in Multimedia Appendix
1, Additional information for networks.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 presents the sociodemographic characteristics of
participants. Within groups, 5063 (6%) heterosexual participants
and 1603 (13.1%) sexual minority youth participants reported
being bullied on college campuses in the past year. The
prevalence of bullying among heterosexual youths was 6%
(95% CI 5.9%-6.2%), and 13.1% (95% CI 12.5%-13.7%) among
sexual minority youths. Furthermore, among gay participants,
the prevalence of bullying was 19.9% (95% CI 17.1%-23.1%),
12.2% (95% CI 9.8%-15.1%) among lesbians, 15.6% (95% CI
13.6%-17.9%) among bisexual males, and 12% (95% CI
11.2%-12.9%) among bisexual females. The odds of being
bullied among sexual minority males was 14.4% (95% CI
12.7%-16.2%), and 11.8% (95% CI 10.6%-13%) among sexual
minority females.

Compared to their heterosexual counterparts, more sexual
minority females, and more sexual minority youths living in
urban residences reported being bullied on the campuses. In
addition, experiences of being bullied were more likely to occur
among participants from nuclear families, with lower annual
family income, or among those who had siblings. Bullied sexual
minority youths also reported higher rates of anxiety, depression,
and PTSD symptoms than bullied heterosexual youths.
Undirected Network Structure
As seen in Figure 1, according to the centrality index EI, GAD2
(Generalized Anxiety Disorders Scale; “control worry,”
EI=1.134) had the highest EI, followed by PHQ4 (Patient Health
Questionnaire; “energy,” EI=1.116), GAD3 (“worry a lot,”
EI=1.085), PHQ2 (“sad mood,” EI=1.078), GAD6 (“irritability,”
EI=1.077), and PTSD4 (“energy,” EI=1.015). These 6 symptoms
played the most central role in the global network of anxiety,
depression, and PTSD symptoms among all bullied sexual

minority youths. The central network structures of the 3 sexual
minority youth subgroups and their centrality index EI are shown
in Table S1 and Figures S1, S2, S3, and S4 in Multimedia

As seen in Figure 2, according to bEI, GAD6 (“irritability,”
bEI=0.954), PHQ8 (“motor,” bEI=0.883), GAD7 (“feeling
afraid,” bEI=0.758), GAD5 (“restless,” bEI=0.718), GAD1
(“nervous,” bEI=0.694), and PHQ2 (“sad mood,” bEI=0.635)
had crucial bridging roles in connecting to the other symptoms
of anxiety, depression, or PTSD, which may possibly transform
from 1 community to another. The bridge network structures
of the 3 sexual minority youth subgroups and their bridge bEI
index are shown in Table S1 and Figures S5, S6, S7, and S8 in

The average predictability of nodes was 48.67%, which means
that, on average, the variance of 48.67% per node could be
explained by its neighbors. In addition, all networks show good
stability in this study (see in Figures S9, S10, S11, and S12 in

(“anhedonia”) had the highest predictive priority for other
symptoms occurring in the anxiety-depression-PTSD network.
PHQ2 (“sad mood”), GAD6 (“irritability”), and GAD7 (“feeling

downstream symptoms had more branches and could activate
more pathways. In addition, there were reversible connections

GAD7 (“feeling afraid”) to PTSD9 (“hypervigilance”) were
unidirectional and irreversible. These results indicate the most

Network Comparison Structures
Figure 4 shows the results when comparing the network
structures between the sexual minority youths and heterosexual

(“appetite”) was significantly stronger in the sexual minority
youth network structure than in the heterosexual.
Among the 3 subgroups of sexual minority youths, there was
no significant difference in edges between the gay or lesbian
network and the other sexual minority youth networks. However,
the edge of PHQ2 (“sad mood”)-PHQ5 (“appetite”) was
strongest in the gay or lesbian network and the edge of PTSD7
(“irritability”)-PTSD10 (“exaggerated startle response”) was
strongest in the bisexual sexual minority youth networks (Figure

Discussion
Principal Findings
This is the first study based on a large-scale sample to
investigate the symptomatic relationship of anxiety, depression,
and PTSD among sexual minority youths bullied on college
campuses in the past. The results partly supported hypothesis
1: sad mood and irritability were identified as the most
frequently crucial activating symptoms of poor mental health,
where emotional cue reactivity was the most central symptom
of the PTSD community. In the Bayesian network, anhedonia
had the highest predictive priority to activate the occurrence of
all other symptoms; feeling afraid played a bridging role in the
anxiety-depression-PTSD network. The results supported
hypothesis 2: compared to heterosexuals, sexual minority youths
exhibited a stronger association between difficulty concentrating
and appetite. The “sad mood-appetite” edge was strongest in
the gay or lesbian network, and the “irritability-exaggerated
startle response” edge was strongest in the bisexual network.
Sexual minority youths has been frequently reported to
experience discrimination, prejudice, and stigma-bias because
of their sexual orientation [6,51], associated with bullying
victimization of sexual minority youths [52,53]. Our study
further reported a high prevalence of being bullied on college
campuses among sexual minority youths, which was 13.3%
(95% CI 12.5%-13.7%, n=1603). Consistent with previous
findings, exposure to bullying on college campuses was found
to be related to the onset of mental health problems among
sexual minority youths [53]. As a meta-analysis supported,
individuals who experience bullying victimization had increased
odds of depression, anxiety, and PTSD [54].
Sad mood and irritability were the most crucial symptoms (both
central and bridge) in all anxiety-depression-PTSD network
models. Previous network analyses have consistently identified
sad mood as the central and bridge symptom in the structure of
the anxiety-depression network [36,55]. This result may be
explained by the external stressors that sexual minority youths
face, making them feel sad [51,56]. According to a US national
survey on youths’risk behavior, high rates of in-school bullying
victimization for homosexuals (28.22%, n=91) and bisexuals
(34.03%, n=318) occurred because of external discrimination
[7]. When under stressful conditions, if those bullied students
experience insufficient support from teachers, they could feel
abandoned and hopeless [57]. In terms of irritability, 2 prior
studies also noted that irritability had a high betweenness index
(another bridge centrality index) [34], and was identified as one
of the central symptoms in the depression-anxiety-PTSD
network [58]. Research has indicated that, once bullied, an
inability to find a coping strategy or resist bullying behaviors
can make individuals feel frustrated, which may trap them in
rumination anger [9]. Moreover, traumatic memories of bullying
victimization could generate severe distress and irritability as
well [59]. Our results showed irritability also had a high
predictive priority of the occurrence of PTSD symptoms.
Findings indicate that for those who do withstand cumulative
bullying victimization, their subjective aggression can be
triggered, potentially increasing their irritable mood and PTSD
symptoms simultaneously [60]. Notably, emotional cue
reactivity (in this study referring to feeling upset by reminders
of the events) was the most central symptom in the PTSD
network. This may be explained by the influences of
autobiographical memories (a mixed memory of complicated
life events) [61]. Experiences of being bullied incur negative
emotional cues, such as insults and physical aggression [62],
and these negative memories would, in turn, cause further
distress.
In the Bayesian network, anhedonia had the highest predictive
priority of activating other symptoms. It parallels a previous
network analysis that identified anhedonia as a central symptom
in the anxiety-depression network [36]. Previous findings
reported that bullying behaviors could lead to poorer mental

health for bullying victims [63]. After being bullied, sexual
minority youths may form a negative schema about an
institution, which influences their interaction with others,
decreasing their interest in participating in activities with their
peers [64]. Another possible explanation could be a lack of
support from teachers and families after exposure to being
bullied, which further hinders sexual minority youths’ mental
health [65] and also makes it harder for them to perceive
pleasure [66]. Additionally, being bullied may negatively
influence the release of dopamine, a chemical produced by
neuronal receptors that relate to feeling good, in the case of
bullying, this causes a lack of pleasure [67]. Feeling afraid also
played a significant bridging role in the Bayesian network,
pointing to the occurrence of hypervigilance in the PTSD
community. On the one hand, past bullying victimization could
lead sexual minority youths to be afraid of reoccurring bullying
[68]; on the other hand, without efficient support from others,
exposing perpetrators of bullying could trigger their fear of
retaliation [69]. In addition, feeling afraid is linked to the
symptoms of PTSD in this study. As early findings stated, those
bullied could incur idiopathic nightmares and sleep problems,
leading to hypervigilance [70]. From the neuropsychological
perspective, fear-related threats increase the steady-state visual
evoked amplitudes, thus heightening individuals’vigilance [71].
Based on this fear of repeated bullying, sexual minority youths’
visual attention to possible danger may present with
over-heightened reactions.
Compared to the heterosexual network structure, difficulty
concentrating was found to be more closely associated with
appetite in the sexual minority youth network structure. As
previous findings stated, sexual minority youths were more
vulnerable to weight-based bullying by peers than heterosexual
youths [72,73]. Moreover, a motivation to avoid or prevent
bullying may be a key driver for those who seek treatment for
obesity [74]. Thus, the ideal body image and weight bias may
result in more sexual minority youths choosing to diet in order
to lose weight or engage in harmful weight-control strategies,
such as purging, to maintain a satisfactory appearance [75]. It
should be noted that over-preoccupation with body shape might
impair concentration in other areas, supported by a previous
study in which those who experienced bullying reported that
they perceived their attention was distracted due to the fear
associated with the experience, which led to difficulty
concentrating when learning and during academic achievement,
further hindering their state of mental well-being [76].
Differently, compared to bullied bisexual youths, sad mood had
a stronger correlation with appetite among bullied gay or lesbian
youths. Researchers consistently report more disordered eating
behaviors in gay or lesbian youths than in bisexuals [77]. In
addition, gay or lesbian youths were reported to have more body
dissatisfaction, driven by an ideal body shape [78,79]. Negative
mood also relates to subjective appetite, causing poor appetite
or overeating [80]. Since discrimination and bullying incur a
sad mood for gay or lesbian youths, they may choose binge
eating to elevate their mood momentarily [81]. Furthermore,
compared to other sexual minority youths, bisexual youths
exhibited a stronger correlation between irritability and
exaggerated startle response. This may be due to bisexual youths
experiencing dual discrimination from homosexual and
heterosexual communities [82]. Since bullying shapes a
threatening context for bisexual youths, they may become
irritable and exhibit a high startle reactivity [83]. Meanwhile,
higher irritability can alter attention bias, with decreased
functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus
and a periaqueductal grey area, which may increase the response
to frustrating stimuli [84].
Limitations
Several limitations should be noted in this study. First, as a
cross-sectional study, it is hard to explore the dynamic process
of psychopathological networks [85], thus, further longitudinal
research is required to obtain causal conclusions. Second, the
replicability and generalizability of network structures are still
limited across various samples [86]. In the future, neuroimaging
studies are required to explore the organic effects on the brain.
Third, measurements were limited in several aspects: (1) the
minority stressors, such as lacking peers or family support, were
not directly measured, and the results could be biased because
of other potential influences. (2) There may be a part of the
youths who have hesitancy toward or concealment of being
identified as sexual minority youths for fear of being exposed
in the context. (3) In addition, the interaction of gender identity
and sexual orientation should be considered in future
investigations. For example, a transgender man attracted to a
cisgender man could also consider himself gay. Further studies
should be conducted covering diverse gender identities in detail.
(4) Because the experience of being bullied on college campuses
in the past was measured by a self-report as well, in which the
standard to determine the conceptualization of bullying varies
across individuals, it was inevitable to include samples with
different severities of bullying victimization. Future research
should provide more detailed standards to define bullying and
explore the underlying mechanism between various types or
levels of bullying behaviors and the impact this has on the
mental health of sexual minority populations. Bullying
off-campus perpetrated by peers should be measured, and its
impacts must be explored. (5) The bias of recall errors or social
desirability effects is unavoidable for data from subjective
reporting scales. Finally, other psychiatric disorders, such as
obsessive-compulsive disorder or eating disorders, were not
measured directly, which may affect the results.
Conclusions
This cross-sectional study based on a large-scale sample,
combined the undirected network analysis and Bayesian network
analysis, for the first time, identifying the most central and
bridge symptoms (sad mood and irritability), as well as the
central role of emotional cue reactivity within the
depression-anxiety-PTSD network of sexual minority youths
who were bullied on college campuses in the past. CPDAG
results also indicated the vital roles of anhedonia and feeling
afraid in the global Bayesian network in this study. In addition,
the comparisons of networks supported three findings: (1)
compared 
to 
heterosexuals, 
the 
edge 
of 
“difficulty
concentrating” was stronger than in the global sexual minority
youth network, (2) the edge of “sad mood-appetite” was
strongest in the gay or lesbian network, and (3) the edge of

“irritability-exaggerated startle response” was strongest in the
bisexual network. These findings should be considered when
offering targeted support for improving the physical health and
mental well-being of sexual minority youths. Consequently,
refined targeted interventions could be formulated [6] to relieve
the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD comorbidity
among sexual minority youths.
