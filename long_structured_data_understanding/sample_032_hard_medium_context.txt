5,4,Using Faults-Slip-Through Metric as a Predictor of Fault-Proneness,"Background: The majority of software faults are present in small number of modules, therefore accurate prediction of fault-prone modules helps improve software quality by focusing testing efforts on a subset of modules. Aims: This paper evaluates the use of the faults-slip-through (FST) metric as a potential predictor of fault-prone modules. Rather than predicting the fault-prone modules for the complete test phase, the prediction is done at the specific test levels of integration and system test. Method: We applied eight classification techniques, to the task of identifying fault prone modules, representing a variety of approaches, including a standard statistical technique for classification (logistic regression), tree-structured classifiers (C4.5 and random forests), a Bayesian technique (Naive Bayes), machine-learning techniques (support vector machines and back-propagation artificial neural networks) and search-based techniques (genetic programming and artificial immune recognition systems) on FST data collected from two large industrial projects from the telecommunication domain. Results: Using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the location of (PF, PD) pairs in the ROC space, the faults slip-through metric showed impressive results with the majority of the techniques for predicting fault-prone modules at both integration and system test levels. There were, however, no statistically significant differences between the performance of different techniques based on AUC, even though certain techniques were more consistent in the classification performance at the two test levels. Conclusions: We can conclude that the faults-slip-through metric is a potentially strong predictor of fault-proneness at integration and system test levels. The faults-slip-through measurements interact in ways that is conveniently accounted for by majority of the data mining techniques.",2010,1,,1.0
20,19,Predicting the location and number of faults in large software systems,"Advance knowledge of which files in the next release of a large software system are most likely to contain the largest numbers of faults can be a very valuable asset. To accomplish this, a negative binomial regression model has been developed and used to predict the expected number of faults in each file of the next release of a system. The predictions are based on the code of the file in the current release, and fault and modification history of the file from previous releases. The model has been applied to two large industrial systems, one with a history of 17 consecutive quarterly releases over 4 years, and the other with nine releases over 2 years. The predictions were quite accurate: for each release of the two systems, the 20 percent of the files with the highest predicted number of faults contained between 71 percent and 92 percent of the faults that were actually detected, with the overall average being 83 percent. The same model was also used to predict which files of the first system were likely to have the highest fault densities (faults per KLOC). In this case, the 20 percent of the files with the highest predicted fault densities contained an average of 62 percent of the system's detected faults. However, the identified files contained a much smaller percentage of the code mass than the files selected to maximize the numbers of faults. The model was also used to make predictions from a much smaller input set that only contained fault data from integration testing and later. The prediction was again very accurate, identifying files that contained from 71 percent to 93 percent of the faults, with the average being 84 percent. Finally, a highly simplified version of the predictor selected files containing, on average, 73 percent and 74 percent of the faults for the two systems.",2005,1,,5.0
24,23,Locating where faults will be [software testing],"The goal of this research is to allow software developers and testers to become aware of which files in the next release of a large software system are likely to contain the largest numbers of faults or the highest fault densities in the next release, thereby allowing testers to focus their efforts on the most fault-prone files. This is done by developing a negative binomial regression model to help predict characteristics of new releases of a software system, based on information collected about prior releases and the new release under development. The same prediction model was also used to allow a tester to select the files of a new release that collectively contain any desired percentage of the faults. The benefit of being able to make these sorts of predictions accurately should be clear: if we know where to look for bugs, we should be able to target our testing efforts there and, as a result, find problems more quickly and therefore more economically. Two case studies using large industrial software systems are summarized. The first study used seventeen consecutive releases of a large inventory system, representing more than four years of field exposure. The second study used nine releases of a service provisioning system with two years of field experience.",2005,1,,11.0
32,31,Software defect association mining and defect correction effort prediction,"Much current software defect prediction work focuses on the number of defects remaining in a software system. In this paper, we present association rule mining based methods to predict defect associations and defect correction effort. This is to help developers detect software defects and assist project managers in allocating testing resources more effectively. We applied the proposed methods to the SEL defect data consisting of more than 200 projects over more than 15 years. The results show that, for defect association prediction, the accuracy is very high and the false-negative rate is very low. Likewise, for the defect correction effort prediction, the accuracy for both defect isolation effort prediction and defect correction effort prediction are also high. We compared the defect correction effort prediction method with other types of methods - PART, C4.5, and Naive Bayes - and show that accuracy has been improved by at least 23 percent. We also evaluated the impact of support and confidence levels on prediction accuracy, false-negative rate, false-positive rate, and the number of rules. We found that higher support and confidence levels may not result in higher prediction accuracy, and a sufficient number of rules is a precondition for high prediction accuracy.",2006,1,,12.0
37,36,A study on fault-proneness detection of object-oriented systems,"Fault-proneness detection in object-oriented systems is an interesting area for software companies and researchers. Several hundred metrics have been defined with the aim of measuring the different aspects of object-oriented systems. Only a few of them have been validated for fault detection, and several interesting works with this view have been considered. This paper reports a research study starting from the analysis of more than 200 different object-oriented metrics extracted from the literature with the aim of identifying suitable models for the detection of the fault-proneness of classes. Such a large number of metrics allows the extraction of a subset of them in order to obtain models that can be adopted for fault-proneness detection. To this end, the whole set of metrics has been classified on the basis of the measured aspect in order to reduce them to a manageable number; then, statistical techniques were employed to produce a hybrid model comprised of 12 metrics. The work has focused on identifying models that can detect as many faulty classes as possible and, at the same time, that are based on a manageably small set of metrics. A compromise between these aspects and the classification correctness of faulty and non-faulty classes was the main challenge of the research. As a result, two models for fault-proneness class detection have been obtained and validated",2001,1,,25.0
19,18,An investigation of the relationships between lines of code and defects (updated),"It is always desirable to understand the quality of a software system based on static code metrics. In this paper, we analyze the relationships between lines of code (LOC) and defects (including both pre-release and post-release defects). We confirm the ranking ability of LOC discovered by Fenton and Ohlsson. Furthermore, we find that the ranking ability of LOC can be formally described using Weibull functions. We can use defect density values calculated from a small percentage of largest modules to predict the number of total defects accurately. We also find that, given LOC we can predict the number of defective components reasonably well using typical classification techniques. We perform an extensive experiment using the public Eclipse dataset, and replicate the study using the NASA dataset. Our results confirm that simple static code attributes such as LOC can be useful predictors of software quality.",2009,1,,28.0
39,38,Naive Bayes Software Defect Prediction Model,"Although the value of using static code attributes to learn defect predictor has been widely debated, there is no doubt that software defect predictions can effectively improve software quality and testing efficiency. Many data mining methods have already been introduced into defect predictions. We noted there have several versions of defect predictor based on Naive Bayes theory, and analyzed their difference estimation method and algorithm complexity. We found the best one which is Multi- variants Gauss Naive Bayes (MvGNB) by performing prediction performance evaluation, and we compared this model with decision tree learner J48. Experiment results on the benchmarking data sets of MDP made us believe that MvGNB would be useful for defect predictions.",2010,1,,29.0
3,2,Test effort optimization by prediction and ranking of fault-prone software modules,"Identification of fault-prone or not fault-prone modules is very essential to improve the reliability and quality of a software system. Once modules are categorized as fault-prone or not fault-prone, test effort are allocated accordingly. Testing effort and efficiency are primary concern and can be optimized by prediction and ranking of fault-prone modules. This paper discusses a new model for prediction and ranking of fault-prone software modules for test effort optimization. Model utilizes the classification capability of data mining techniques and knowledge stored in software metrics to classify the software module as fault-prone or not fault-prone. A decision tree is constructed using ID3 algorithm for the existing project data. Rules are derived form the decision tree and integrated with fuzzy inference system to classify the modules as either fault-prone or not fault-prone for the target data. The model is also able to rank the fault-prone module on the basis of its degree of fault-proneness. The model accuracy are validated and compared with some other models by using the NASA projects data set of PROMOSE repository.",2010,1,,33.0
9,8,Application of neural network for predicting software development faults using object-oriented design metrics (updated),"In this paper, we present the application of neural network for predicting software development faults including object-oriented faults. Object-oriented metrics can be used in quality estimation. In practice, quality estimation means either estimating reliability or maintainability. In the context of object-oriented metrics work, reliability is typically measured as the number of defects. Object-oriented design metrics are used as the independent variables and the number of faults is used as dependent variable in our study. Software metrics used include those concerning inheritance measures, complexity measures, coupling measures and object memory allocation measures. We also test the goodness of fit of neural network model by comparing the prediction result for software faults with multiple regression model. Our study is conducted on three industrial real-time systems that contain a number of natural faults that has been reported for three years (Mei-Huei Tang et al., 1999).",2002,1,,42.0
27,26,Tree-based software quality estimation models for fault prediction (updated),"Complex high-assurance software systems depend highly on reliability of their underlying software applications. Early identification of high-risk modules can assist in directing quality enhancement efforts to modules that are likely to have a high number of faults. Regression tree models are simple and effective as software quality prediction models, and timely predictions from such models can be used to achieve high software reliability. This paper presents a case study from our comprehensive evaluation (with several large case studies) of currently available regression tree algorithms for software fault prediction. These are, CART-LS (least squares), S-PLUS, and CART-LAD (least absolute deviation). The case study presented comprises of software design metrics collected from a large network telecommunications system consisting of almost 13 million lines of code. Tree models using design metrics are built to predict the number of faults in modules. The algorithms are also compared based on the structure and complexity of their tree models. Performance metrics, average absolute and average relative errors are used to evaluate fault prediction accuracy.",2002,1,,46.0
7,6,Variance Analysis in Software Fault Prediction Models (updated),"Software fault prediction models play an important role in software quality assurance. They identify software subsystems (modules,components, classes, or files) which are likely to contain faults. These subsystems, in turn, receive additional resources for verification and validation activities. Fault prediction models are binary classifiers typically developed using one of the supervised learning techniques from either a subset of the fault data from the current project or from a similar past project. In practice, it is critical that such models provide a reliable prediction performance on the data not used in training. Variance is an important reliability indicator of software fault prediction models. However, variance is often ignored or barely mentioned in many published studies. In this paper, through the analysis of twelve data sets from a public software engineering repository from the perspective of variance, we explore the following five questions regarding fault prediction models: (1) Do different types ofclassification performance measures exhibit different variance? (2) Does the size of the data set imply a more (or less) accurate prediction performance? (3) Does the size of training subset impact model's stability? (4) Do different classifiers consistently exhibit different performance in terms of model's variance? (5) Are there differences between variance from 1000 runs and 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation experiments? Our results indicate that variance is a very important factor in understanding fault prediction models and we recommend the best practice for reporting variance in empirical software engineering studies.",2009,1,,48.0
33,32,Assessing the applicability of fault-proneness models across object-oriented software projects (updated),"A number of papers have investigated the relationships between design metrics and the detection of faults in object-oriented software. Several of these studies have shown that such models can be accurate in predicting faulty classes within one particular software product. In practice, however, prediction models are built on certain products to be used on subsequent software development projects. How accurate can these models be, considering the inevitable differences that may exist across projects and systems? Organizations typically learn and change. From a more general standpoint, can we obtain any evidence that such models are economically viable tools to focus validation and verification effort? This paper attempts to answer these questions by devising a general but tailorable cost-benefit model and by using fault and design data collected on two mid-size Java systems developed in the same environment. Another contribution of the paper is the use of a novel exploratory analysis technique - MARS (multivariate adaptive regression splines) to build such fault-proneness models, whose functional form is a-priori unknown. The results indicate that a model built on one system can be accurately used to rank classes within another system according to their fault proneness. The downside, however, is that, because of system differences, the predicted fault probabilities are not representative of the system predicted. However, our cost-benefit model demonstrates that the MARS fault-proneness model is potentially viable, from an economical standpoint. The linear model is not nearly as good, thus suggesting a more complex model is required.",2002,1,,52.0
10,9,Using the Conceptual Cohesion of Classes for Fault Prediction in Object-Oriented Systems,"High cohesion is a desirable property of software as it positively impacts understanding, reuse, and maintenance. Currently proposed measures for cohesion in Object-Oriented (OO) software reflect particular interpretations of cohesion and capture different aspects of it. Existing approaches are largely based on using the structural information from the source code, such as attribute references, in methods to measure cohesion. This paper proposes a new measure for the cohesion of classes in OO software systems based on the analysis of the unstructured information embedded in the source code, such as comments and identifiers. The measure, named the Conceptual Cohesion of Classes (C3), is inspired by the mechanisms used to measure textual coherence in cognitive psychology and computational linguistics. This paper presents the principles and the technology that stand behind the C3 measure. A large case study on three open source software systems is presented which compares the new measure with an extensive set of existing metrics and uses them to construct models that predict software faults. The case study shows that the novel measure captures different aspects of class cohesion compared to any of the existing cohesion measures. In addition, combining C3 with existing structural cohesion metrics proves to be a better predictor of faulty classes when compared to different combinations of structural cohesion metrics.",2008,1,,53.0
14,13,Use of relative code churn measures to predict system defect density,"Software systems evolve over time due to changes in requirements, optimization of code, fixes for security and reliability bugs etc. Code churn, which measures the changes made to a component over a period of time, quantifies the extent of this change. We present a technique for early prediction of system defect density using a set of relative code churn measures that relate the amount of churn to other variables such as component size and the temporal extent of churn. Using statistical regression models, we show that while absolute measures of code chum are poor predictors of defect density, our set of relative measures of code churn is highly predictive of defect density. A case study performed on Windows Server 2003 indicates the validity of the relative code churn measures as early indicators of system defect density. Furthermore, our code churn metric suite is able to discriminate between fault and not fault-prone binaries with an accuracy of 89.0 percent.",2005,1,,58.0
13,12,Software Fault Prediction Model Based on Adaptive Dynamical and Median Particle Swarm Optimization,"Software quality prediction can play a role of importance in software management, and thus in improve the quality of software systems. By mining software with data mining technique, predictive models can be induced that software managers the insights they need to tackle these quality problems in an efficient way. This paper deals with the adaptive dynamic and median particle swarm optimization (ADMPSO) based on the PSO classification technique. ADMPSO can act as a valid data mining technique to predict erroneous software modules. The predictive model in this paper extracts the relationship rules of software quality and metrics. Information entropy approach is applied to simplify the extraction rule set. The empirical result shows that this method set of rules can be streamlined and the forecast accuracy can be improved.",2010,1,,62.0
38,37,Fault Prediction using Early Lifecycle Data,"The prediction of fault-prone modules in a software project has been the topic of many studies. In this paper, we investigate whether metrics available early in the development lifecycle can be used to identify fault-prone software modules. More precisely, we build predictive models using the metrics that characterize textual requirements. We compare the performance of requirements-based models against the performance of code-based models and models that combine requirement and code metrics. Using a range of modeling techniques and the data from three NASA projects, our study indicates that the early lifecycle metrics can play an important role in project management, either by pointing to the need for increased quality monitoring during the development or by using the models to assign verification and validation activities.",2007,1,,68.0
16,15,Empirical assessment of machine learning based software defect prediction techniques,"The wide-variety of real-time software systems, including telecontrol/telepresence systems, robotic systems, and mission planning systems, can entail dynamic code synthesis based on runtime mission-specific requirements and operating conditions. This necessitates the need for dynamic dependability assessment to ensure that these systems perform as specified and not fail in catastrophic ways. One approach in achieving this is to dynamically assess the modules in the synthesized code using software defect prediction techniques. Statistical models; such as stepwise multi-linear regression models and multivariate models, and machine learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks, instance-based reasoning, Bayesian-belief networks, decision trees, and rule inductions, have been investigated for predicting software quality. However, there is still no consensus about the best predictor model for software defects. In this paper; we evaluate different predictor models on four different real-time software defect data sets. The results show that a combination of IR and instance-based learning along with the consistency-based subset evaluation technique provides a relatively better consistency in accuracy prediction compared to other models. The results also show that ""size"" and ""complexity"" metrics are not sufficient for accurately predicting real-time software defects.",2005,1,,85.0
17,16,Cost Curve Evaluation of Fault Prediction Models,"Prediction of fault prone software components is one of the most researched problems in software engineering. Many statistical techniques have been proposed but there is no consensus on the methodology to select the ""best model"" for the specific project. In this paper, we introduce and discuss the merits of cost curve analysis of fault prediction models. Cost curves allow software quality engineers to introduce project-specific cost of module misclassification into model evaluation. Classifying a software module as fault-prone implies the application of some verification activities, thus adding to the development cost. Misclassifying a module as fault free carries the risk of system failure, also associated with cost implications. Through the analysis of sixteen projects from public repositories, we observe that software quality does not necessarily benefit from the prediction of fault prone components. The inclusion of misclassification cost in model evaluation may indicate that even the ""best"" models achieve performance no better than trivial classification. Our results support a recommendation to adopt cost curves as one of the standard methods for software quality model performance evaluation.",2008,1,,87.0
34,33,A Novel Evaluation Method for Defect Prediction in Software Systems,"In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation method for defect prediction in object-oriented software systems. For each metric to evaluate, we start by applying it to the dependency graph extracted from the target software system, and obtain a list of classes ordered by their predicted degree of defect under that metric. By utilizing the actual defect data mined from the subversion database, we evaluate the quality of each metric through means of a weighted reciprocal ranking mechanism. Our method can tell not only the overall quality of each evaluated metric, but also the quality of the prediction result for each class, especially those costly ones. Evaluation results and analysis show the efficiency and rationality of our method.",2010,1,,89.0
36,35,Empirical Analysis of Software Fault Content and Fault Proneness Using Bayesian Methods,"We present a methodology for Bayesian analysis of software quality. We cast our research in the broader context of constructing a causal framework that can include process, product, and other diverse sources of information regarding fault introduction during the software development process. In this paper, we discuss the aspect of relating internal product metrics to external quality metrics. Specifically, we build a Bayesian network (BN) model to relate object-oriented software metrics to software fault content and fault proneness. Assuming that the relationship can be described as a generalized linear model, we derive parametric functional forms for the target node conditional distributions in the BN. These functional forms are shown to be able to represent linear, Poisson, and binomial logistic regression. The models are empirically evaluated using a public domain data set from a software subsystem. The results show that our approach produces statistically significant estimations and that our overall modeling method performs no worse than existing techniques.",2007,1,,90.0
31,30,Transparent combination of expert and measurement data for defect prediction: an industrial case study,"Defining strategies on how to perform quality assurance (QA) and how to control such activities is a challenging task for organizations developing or maintaining software and software-intensive systems. Planning and adjusting QA activities could benefit from accurate estimations of the expected defect content of relevant artifacts and the effectiveness of important quality assurance activities. Combining expert opinion with commonly available measurement data in a hybrid way promises to overcome the weaknesses of purely data-driven or purely expert-based estimation methods. This article presents a case study of the hybrid estimation method HyDEEP for estimating defect content and QA effectiveness in the telecommunication domain. The specific focus of this case study is the use of the method for gaining quantitative predictions. This aspect has not been empirically analyzed in previous work. Among other things, the results show that for defect content estimation, the method performs significantly better statistically than purely data-based methods, with a relative error of 0.3 on average (MMRE).",2010,1,,102.0
28,27,Predicting fault prone modules by the Dempster-Shafer belief networks,"This paper describes a novel methodology for predicting fault prone modules. The methodology is based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief networks. Our approach consists of three steps: first, building the D-S network by the induction algorithm; second, selecting the predictors (attributes) by the logistic procedure; third, feeding the predictors describing the modules of the current project into the inducted D-S network and identifying fault prone modules. We applied this methodology to a NASA dataset. The prediction accuracy of our methodology is higher than that achieved by logistic regression or discriminant analysis on the same dataset.",2003,1,,106.0
11,10,Software Fault Prediction using Language Processing,"Accurate prediction of faulty modules reduces the cost of software development and evolution. Two case studies with a language-processing based fault prediction measure are presented. The measure, refereed to as a QALP score, makes use of techniques from information retrieval to judge software quality. The QALP score has been shown to correlate with human judgements of software quality. The two case studies consider the measure's application to fault prediction using two programs (one open source, one proprietary). Linear mixed-effects regression models are used to identify relationships between defects and QALP score. Results, while complex, show that little correlation exists in the first case study, while statistically significant correlations exists in the second. In this second study the QALP score is helpful in predicting faults in modules (files) with its usefulness growing as module size increases.",2007,1,,113.0
8,7,Evaluating Defect Prediction Models for a Large Evolving Software System (updated),"A plethora of defect prediction models has been proposed and empirically evaluated, often using standard classification performance measures. In this paper, we explore defect prediction models for a large, multi-release software system from the telecommunications domain. A history of roughly 3 years is analyzed to extract process and static code metrics that are used to build several defect prediction models with random forests. The performance of the resulting models is comparable to previously published work. Furthermore, we develop a new evaluation measure based on the comparison to an optimal model.",2009,1,,121.0
21,20,Predictive data mining model for software bug estimation using average weighted similarity,"Software bug estimation is a very essential activity for effective and proper software project planning. All the software bug related data are kept in software bug repositories. Software bug (defect) repositories contains lot of useful information related to the development of a project. Data mining techniques can be applied on these repositories to discover useful interesting patterns. In this paper a prediction data mining technique is proposed to predict the software bug estimation from a software bug repository. A two step prediction model is proposed In the first step bug for which estimation is required, its summary and description is matched against the summary and description of bugs available in bug repositories. A weighted similarity model is suggested to match the summary and description for a pair of software bugs. In the second step the fix duration of all the similar bugs are calculated and stored and its average is calculated, which indicates the predicted estimation of a bug. The proposed model is implemented using open source technologies and is explained with the help of illustrative example.",2010,1,,122.0
29,28,Building a genetically engineerable evolvable program (GEEP) using breadth-based explicit knowledge for predicting software defects,"There has been extensive research in the area of data mining over the last decade, but relatively little research in algorithmic mining. Some researchers shun the idea of incorporating explicit knowledge with a Genetic Program environment. At best, very domain specific knowledge is hard wired into the GP modeling process. This work proposes a new approach called the Genetically Engineerable Evolvable Program (GEEP). In this approach, explicit knowledge is made available to the GP. It is considered breadth-based, in that all pieces of knowledge are independent of each other. Several experiments are performed on a NASA-based data set using established equations from other researchers in order to predict software defects. All results are statistically validated.",2004,1,,123.0
35,34,Merits of using repository metrics in defect prediction for open source projects (updated),Many corporate code developers are the beta testers of open source software. They continue testing until they are sure that they have a stable version to build their code on. In this respect defect predictors play a critical role to identify defective parts of the software. Performance of a defect predictor is determined by correctly finding defective parts of the software without giving any false alarms. Having high false alarms means testers/developers would inspect bug free code unnecessarily. Therefore in this research we focused on decreasing the false alarm rates by using repository metrics. We conducted experiments on the data sets of Eclipse project. Our results showed that repository metrics decreased the false alarm rates on the average to 23% from 32% corresponding up to 907 less files to inspect.,2009,1,,127.0
22,21,A Comparative Study of Ensemble Feature Selection Techniques for Software Defect Prediction,"Feature selection has become the essential step in many data mining applications. Using a single feature subset selection method may generate local optima. Ensembles of feature selection methods attempt to combine multiple feature selection methods instead of using a single one. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining 17 different ensembles of feature ranking techniques (rankers) including six commonly-used feature ranking techniques, the signal-to-noise filter technique, and 11 threshold-based feature ranking techniques. This study utilized 16 real-world software measurement data sets of different sizes and built 13,600 classification models. Experimental results indicate that ensembles of very few rankers are very effective and even better than ensembles of many or all rankers.",2010,1,,134.0
23,22,Developing fault predictors for evolving software systems,"Over the past several years, we have been developing methods of predicting the fault content of software systems based on measured characteristics of their structural evolution. In previous work, we have shown there is a significant linear relationship between code churn, a synthesized metric, and the rate at which faults are inserted into the system in terms of number of faults per unit change in code churn. We have begun a new investigation of this relationship with a flight software technology development effort at the jet propulsion laboratory (JPL) and have progressed in resolving the limitations of the earlier work in two distinct steps. First, we have developed a standard for the enumeration of faults. Second, we have developed a practical framework for automating the measurement of these faults. we analyze the measurements of structural evolution and fault counts obtained from the JPL flight software technology development effort. Our results indicate that the measures of structural attributes of the evolving software system are suitable for forming predictors of the number of faults inserted into software modules during their development. The new fault standard also ensures that the model so developed has greater predictive validity.",2003,1,,136.0
4,3,A Rough Set Model for Software Defect Prediction,High assurance software requires extensive and expensive assessment. Many software organizations frequently do not allocate enough resources for software quality. We research the defect detectors focusing on the data sets of software defect prediction. A rough set model is presented to deal with the attributes of data sets of software defect prediction in this paper. Appling this model to the most famous public domain data set created by the NASA's metrics data program shows its splendid performance.,2008,1,,138.0
18,17,A practical method for the software fault-prediction,"In the paper, a novel machine learning method, SimBoost, is proposed to handle the software fault-prediction problem when highly skewed datasets are used. Although the method, proved by empirical results, can make the datasets much more balanced, the accuracy of the prediction is still not satisfactory. Therefore, a fuzzy-based representation of the software module fault state has been presented instead of the original faulty/non-faulty one. Several experiments were conducted using datasets from NASA Metrics Data Program. The discussion of the results of experiments is provided.",2007,1,,145.0
15,14,Predicting defects in SAP Java code: An experience report (updated),"Which components of a large software system are the most defect-prone? In a study on a large SAP Java system, we evaluated and compared a number of defect predictors, based on code features such as complexity metrics, static error detectors, change frequency, or component imports, thus replicating a number of earlier case studies in an industrial context. We found the overall predictive power to be lower than expected; still, the resulting regression models successfully predicted 50-60% of the 20% most defect-prone components.",2009,1,,160.0
30,29,Applying Novel Resampling Strategies To Software Defect Prediction,"Due to the tremendous complexity and sophistication of software, improving software reliability is an enormously difficult task. We study the software defect prediction problem, which focuses on predicting which modules will experience a failure during operation. Numerous studies have applied machine learning to software defect prediction; however, skewness in defect-prediction datasets usually undermines the learning algorithms. The resulting classifiers will often never predict the faulty minority class. This problem is well known in machine learning and is often referred to as learning from unbalanced datasets. We examine stratification, a widely used technique for learning unbalanced data that has received little attention in software defect prediction. Our experiments are focused on the SMOTE technique, which is a method of over-sampling minority-class examples. Our goal is to determine if SMOTE can improve recognition of defect-prone modules, and at what cost. Our experiments demonstrate that after SMOTE resampling, we have a more balanced classification. We found an improvement of at least 23% in the average geometric mean classification accuracy on four benchmark datasets.",2007,1,,167.0
6,5,Reducing Features to Improve Bug Prediction (updated),"Recently, machine learning classifiers have emerged as a way to predict the existence of a bug in a change made to a source code file. The classifier is first trained on software history data, and then used to predict bugs. Two drawbacks of existing classifier-based bug prediction are potentially insufficient accuracy for practical use, and use of a large number of features. These large numbers of features adversely impact scalability and accuracy of the approach. This paper proposes a feature selection technique applicable to classification-based bug prediction. This technique is applied to predict bugs in software changes, and performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers is characterized.",2009,1,,173.0
25,24,Estimating software fault-proneness for tuning testing activities (updated),"The article investigates whether a correlation exists between the fault-proneness of software and the measurable attributes of the code (i.e. the static metrics) and of the testing (i.e. the dynamic metrics). The article also studies how to use such data for tuning the testing process. The goal is not to find a general solution to the problem (a solution may not even exist), but to investigate the scope of specific solutions, i.e., to what extent homogeneity of the development process, organization, environment and application domain allows data computed on past projects to be projected onto new projects. A suitable variety of case studies is selected to investigate a methodology applicable to classes of homogeneous products, rather than investigating if a specific solution exists for few cases.",2000,1,,185.0
26,25,The Application of Gray-Prediction Theory in the Software Defects Management (updated),"Software defects are the parts of software products that software development company have to face. How to deal with them suitably is very important for software company's survival. This article will use the collecting data of software defects. Then, according to GM (1, 1), which is the core theory of the gray-prediction, establish the prediction model. Finally, we gain the prediction values. The results show that software company can improve software quality, control development process and allocate resources effectively.",2009,1,,250.0
12,11,Visualization of test information to assist fault localization (updated),"One of the most expensive and time-consuming components of the debugging process is locating the errors or faults. To locate faults, developers must identify statements involved in failures and select suspicious statements that might contain faults. The paper presents a technique that uses visualization to assist with these tasks. The technique uses color to visually map the participation of each program statement in the outcome of the execution of the program with a test suite, consisting of both passed and failed test cases. Based on this visual mapping, a user can inspect the statements in the program, identify statements involved in failures, and locate potentially faulty statements. The paper also describes a prototype tool that implements our technique along with a set of empirical studies that use the tool for evaluation of the technique. The empirical studies show that, for the subject we studied, the technique can be effective in helping a user locate faults in a program.",2002,1,,366.0
