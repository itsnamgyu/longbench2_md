- Countries with high levels of institutional and social fragility, identified based on publicly available indicators that measure the quality of policy and institutions and manifestations of fragility.
- Countries affected by violent conflict, identified based on a threshold number of conflict-related deaths relative to the population. This category includes two sub-categories based on the intensity of violence: countries in high-intensity conflict and countries in medium-intensity conflict.

ST.INT.RCPT.CD,"International tourism, receipts (current US$)","International tourism receipts are expenditures by international inbound visitors, including payments to national carriers for international transport. These receipts include any other prepayment made for goods or services received in the destination country. They also may include receipts from same-day visitors, except when these are important enough to justify separate classification. For some countries they do not include receipts for passenger transport items. Data are in current U.S. dollars.","World Tourism Organization, Yearbook of Tourism Statistics, Compendium of Tourism Statistics and data files."

0,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies."
1,9,2,Elderly Woman,Hippies?
2,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[walks in and begins to rap the walls with his fist] Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies. [raps on the wall and the pitch changes] Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?"
3,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am. [she climbs up until her eyes are level with his] See that? Hippies. [five hippies are sitting in a clearing in the attic, smoking and laughing.]"
4,9,2,Elderly Woman,Oh my.
5,9,2,Eric Cartman,"These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard."
6,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. [eight hippies are seen seated around a small campfire drumming away. Logs are scattered around them]"
7,9,2,Elderly Woman,"Oh, well they showed up a few days ago, but I didn't think they were hurting anything."
8,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony."
9,9,2,Elderly Woman,Oh dear.
10,9,2,Elderly Woman,"Oh, well, so, so what do I do?"
11,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[goes back to rapping the walls, then stops] Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas. [raps again. The wall begins to crack and he steps aside. A hippie breaks through and falls to the floor. Cartman says under his breath] God dammit! [pulls out a fire extinguisher from his backpack]"
12,9,2,Hippie 1,"[dazed and confused, coughing] Whoa, how did I get here? Man, I'm so high."
13,9,2,Eric Cartman,God damn hippie! [opens fire. Foam spews out from the extinguisher]
14,9,2,Hippie 1,"Whoa, dude!"
15,9,2,Eric Cartman,Get out of here!
16,9,2,Hippie 1,Not cool! [stands up and looks at Cartman] What's up?! [runs off]
17,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!"
18,9,2,Elderly Woman,Ooooo...what's that?
19,9,2,Eric Cartman,The college know-it-all hippies.
20,9,2,Driver,"[wearing green jacket] Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place."
21,9,2,Woman 1,"[wearing tan jacket] Yeah, this will be a great place to spend spring break. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach them]"
22,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, let's ask them. [the boys are wearing shoulder totes with magazines peeking out from them.]"
23,9,2,Stan Marsh,"All right. [the two parties meet] 'Scuse me. [holds out a clipboard] Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?"
24,9,2,Driver,"Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?"
25,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,Wha- whataya mean?
26,9,2,Man 1,"[wearing a guitar over his back] You're playing into the corporate game! See, the corporations are trying to turn you into little Eichmann's so that they can make money. [the other man is busily eating chips]"
27,9,2,Stan Marsh,Who are the corporations?
28,9,2,Woman 2,[a blonde with a psychedelic fish on her shirt] The corporations run the entire world. And now they fooled you into working for them.
29,9,2,Stan Marsh,Are you serious? We never heard that.
30,9,2,Driver,We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.
31,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,Ugh! Those dirty liars!
32,9,2,Kenny McCormick,(Sonofabitch!) [throws down his shoulder tote]
33,9,2,Man 2,[has finished his chips] This is a really nice town you have here. That's why the corporations are trying to use you to take it down.
34,9,2,Stan Marsh,Well... Well what do we do?
35,9,2,Driver,Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. [Man 2 resumes eating chips]
36,9,2,Hippie 2,[wearing a headband] It is time to let us out! I'm sending your names! Open this door right now!
37,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[opens the door real quick and tosses another hippie down the stairs] All right, in you go."
38,9,2,Hippie 2,"What are you doing, man?!"
39,9,2,Hippie 3,[wearing a V-neck sweater] Let us out! [the throng advances up the stairs]
40,9,2,Eric Cartman,Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! [the throng backs down]
41,9,2,Hippie 2,"What's up, man?! You can't keep us down here like this!"
42,9,2,Hippie 4,[with straight long hair] What's wrong with you?!
43,9,2,Eric Cartman,What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
44,9,2,Hippie 5,[wearing a thin headband] What makes you think you could tell us where to live?!
45,9,2,Hippie 6,"This is a free country, man!"
46,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it."
47,9,2,Hippie 3,Just go with it? We've been down here for days!
48,9,2,Eric Cartman,"And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints [tosses a bunch of joints down to the hippies], and a guitar! [tosses that down as well and shuts the door. He then locks it and sets a large beam across the door, then walks away. The hippies are left there, coughing. One of them takes the guitar and sings]"
49,9,2,Singer,What's goin' on in this world o'mine?There's a whole lot of killin' in this world o'mine. Somebody's gotta help this world o'mine...
50,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind."
51,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"[peeks out through the sliding doors] Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?"
52,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read."
53,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"Okay, sweetie."
54,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B."
55,9,2,Chef,"[Secretary of Public Safety] Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!"
56,9,2,Linda Stotch,[City Clerk and Treasurer] We don't have it in the budget to fix them right now.
57,9,2,Gerald Broflovski,[City Attorney] We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.
58,9,2,Chef,"We- [a struggle is heard in the hall and the council members turn to see what it is. The door opens and Cartman rushes in, roughed up]"
59,9,2,Guard,You can't go in there!
60,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Please, I have to talk to you all right now!"
61,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Kid, we're have a city council meeting."
62,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!"
63,9,2,Randy Marsh,[Secretary of Parks and Public Grounds] What are you talking about?
64,9,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it. [some surprise is seen among the council members] For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town. [puts a laptop on the table and turns it on] At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence. [pulls a projector towards the laptop] Then I saw this... [connects the projector to the laptop, and the projector turns on. Everyone then looks at the screen. Cartman goes to it and points a few things out] Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... [close-up]. hippie music festival."
65,9,2,Linda Stotch,A what?
66,9,2,Eric Cartman,"It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. [the adults don't get it, Cartman sighs heavily]"
67,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Kid, what the hell are you talking about?"
68,9,2,Eric Cartman,"I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!"
69,9,2,Mr Mackey,"Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay."
70,9,2,Eric Cartman,It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
71,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Johnson, get him out of here. [Johnson rises and goes for Cartman]"
72,9,2,Eric Cartman,"What are you doing?! [Johnson hauls him away] You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug! [he disappears from view, but peeks in one last time] The town is in serious danger! [Johnson returns to close the door]"
73,9,2,Driver,"You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind."
74,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Right, so how do we get back at them?"
75,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we're pissed off."
76,9,2,Driver,"Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down. [foam appears out of nowhere and covers the hippie driver] Whoa, what the hell?! [Cartman appears]"
77,9,2,Eric Cartman,"I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!"
78,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!"
79,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[stops and thinks through what he just heard, then turns around] Oh Jesus, not you guys? [approaches Stan and checks him out] What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!"
80,9,2,Stan Marsh,[alarmed] NO!
81,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. [the hippie that wore the guitar over his shoulder approaches the boys]"
82,9,2,Man 1,"What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann. [Cartman sprays mace on him and he cries out in pain]"
83,9,2,Woman 2,Oh my God!
84,9,2,Man 2,What the hell are you doing?! [a police car pulls up in the background and Officer Barbrady steps out of the car. He comes for Eric]
85,9,2,Eric Cartman,Everybody get in a single-file line!
86,9,2,Officer Barbrady,There you are!
87,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted."
88,9,2,Officer Barbrady,"Eric Cartman, you are under arrest."
89,9,2,Eric Cartman,What?
90,9,2,Officer Barbrady,I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
91,9,2,Eric Cartman,"You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!"
92,9,2,Officer Barbrady,"Oh no, you're coming downtown! [hauls Cartman away to the police cruiser]"
93,9,2,Eric Cartman,"No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! [Barbrady puts him in the passenger seat, then gets into the driver's seat and peels away]"
94,9,2,Driver,Who was that?
95,9,2,Eric Cartman,What did I do?!
96,9,2,Officer Barbrady,You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
97,9,2,Eric Cartman,"They're not people, they're HIPPIES!"
98,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,Is this problem under control?
99,9,2,Officer Barbrady,"I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz."
100,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[walks to his cell door] Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!"
101,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,I know. I signed the permit.
102,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[steps back, stunned] You... You what?"
103,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little ""festival"" should pump some money into our economy."
104,9,2,Eric Cartman,They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
105,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!
106,9,2,Eric Cartman,You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! [Cartman snaps]
107,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,That kid really needs some psychiatric help.
108,9,2,Officer Barbrady,Yeah.
109,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, let's go."
110,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[quickly composes himself] How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!"
111,9,2,Announcer,This is a South Park News special report! [a crowd scene is shown beside the anchorman]
112,9,2,Anchorman,"Thousands of people have descended on South Park for a hippie music jam festival. The event is said to be the largest such gathering in the history of man. [the crowd scene fills the screen and the MC comes up to the main mic. The stage is set up solidly, with speakers ]"
113,9,2,MC,"All right, welcome to Hippie Jam Fest 2005! [the crowd raises a cheer] Sooo great to see sooo many people turn out to make an impact on on the world! [more cheering follows]"
114,9,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
115,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,You said it!
116,9,2,MC,"For too long, the corporations have bled the world of its love and resources! It is time for us to get to work and make the world a better place! And we're gonna start right now. [launches into a jam with his band. The college hippies are in the audience]"
117,9,2,Man 1,"[coughs] Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove. [goes back to smoking pot]"
118,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?"
119,9,2,Sharon Marsh,He went with his friends to that music festival.
120,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!"
121,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s."
122,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there."
123,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"You ate too much acid, man! [she resumes dancing and slips onto the vomit, face up. Randy pounces on her and starts banging her, sort of. They still have their clothes on.]"
124,9,2,Sharon Marsh,...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.
125,9,2,Randy Marsh,[panics] S-stan. STAAAN!
126,9,2,Announcer,This is South Park News!
127,9,2,Anchorman,Fear and horror in South Park today as the music festival continues to grow. [live footage is shown] They're arriving in droves and apparently no end is in sight.
128,9,2,Reporter,"Tom, the crowd just keeps getting bigger and the town is literally bursting at the seams. We don't know where this music festival came from, but, it's very close to consuming us all."
129,9,2,Linda Stotch,"Steven, what do we do?"
130,9,2,Randy Marsh,"[frantic] Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! [Jimbo approaches him]"
131,9,2,Jimbo Kern,"[restrains Randy] Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!"
132,9,2,Randy Marsh,My son is in there! Duh-uh! [breaks away from Jimbo and disappears among the hippies. He reaches a clearing] Stan?! [the marijuana smoke is too much for him. He coughs harshly] Stan! Stan!
133,9,2,Male hippie,"Hey, chill man. It's all good."
134,9,2,Female hippie,Have some water laced with acid.
135,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Sta-ogh. Ugh! [he falls to the ground gagging, then gets into a fetal position and passes out]"
136,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,What have I done?
137,9,2,MC,"Yeah, South Park is now the hippie capital of the world! [a loud cheer rises from the crowd. The Mayor raises her right arm. In her hand is gun. She points it at her temple. the camera moves to the right, the gun goes off, and bits of brain, skull, and blood hit the wall to the right. Her body is heard dropping to the floor]"
138,9,2,Mr Mackey,"Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?"
139,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[gets off his bed] Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it."
140,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?"
141,9,2,Eric Cartman,[angered] Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
142,9,2,Sheila Broflovski,"We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!"
143,9,2,Eric Cartman,[a bit resentful] Forget it. [turns his back on them and walks back to his bed]
144,9,2,Randy Marsh,Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
145,9,2,Chef,Yeah. We apologize.
146,9,2,Jimbo Kern,Please. Don't let them ruin our town.
147,9,2,Eric Cartman,"It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!"
148,9,2,Mr Mackey,"We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay?"
149,9,2,Randy Marsh,"We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. [Sheila presents a cake, and Randy helps out. The cake says Eric on it]"
150,9,2,Eric Cartman,[turns away again] Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
151,9,2,Randy Marsh,[thinks a moment] It's yours.
152,9,2,Eric Cartman,I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
153,9,2,Principal Victoria,Fine.
154,9,2,Jimbo Kern,Anything else?
155,9,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. [turns around] Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
156,9,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th- [Rand nudges her hard] Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you."
157,9,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! [The adults just look back at him]"
158,9,2,Driver,"Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed."
159,9,2,Stan Marsh,So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
160,9,2,Man 1,"[take a deep drag from his joint] Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!"
161,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em."
162,9,2,Man 2,Right now we're proving we don't need corporations. We don't need money. This can become a commune where everyone just helps each other.
163,9,2,Man 1,"Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety."
164,9,2,Stan Marsh,You mean like a baker and a cop?
165,9,2,Man 2,"No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services?"
166,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's called a town."
167,9,2,Driver,"You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE."
168,9,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick."
169,9,2,Randy Marsh,[closes his eyes] My God...
170,9,2,Eric Cartman,"In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here. [points to the stage] If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system. [shows off a CD-R of Slayer music] Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all."
171,9,2,Jimbo Kern,"Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?"
172,9,2,Eric Cartman,We drill. [flips the page and a blueprint appears.] I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
173,9,2,Steven Stotch,Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? It's a suicide mission!
174,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong."
175,9,2,Randy Marsh,I'm the... only scientist in town.
176,9,2,Linda Stotch,I'm your engineer.
177,9,2,Steven Stotch,"Honey, no!"
178,9,2,Linda Stotch,"I have to do it, Steven."
179,9,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. [he looks around, panning by Chef once] Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see... [his gaze passes Chef again] Oh, I know. How about- [his gaze falls upon Chef and stays there]"
180,9,2,Chef,"Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!"
181,9,2,Steven Stotch,I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan!
182,9,2,Randy Marsh,"You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!"
183,9,2,Eric Cartman,"There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we- [his face is distorted. Moments later he sneezes and his face is normal again.] got."
184,9,2,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where a desperate attempt to save the town is underway. Some call it a suicide mission, but the heroic men and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival. [Cartman's team enters through the doors of Bay 2]"
185,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Well I... guess this is it, Sharon."
186,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"Please, save our boy, Randy."
187,9,2,Linda Stotch,"Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy."
188,9,2,Butters Stotch,"Ah I will, Mom."
189,9,2,Chef,"[with two ladies crying on his shoulders] Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine."
190,9,2,Eric Cartman,"I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog. [his plush toy sits on a chair] Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. [smiles, wipes a tear from his eye, and joins the rest of the crew into the hippie digger. They turn to wave at the townsfolk, who cheer and wave back. Some people take pictures]"
191,9,2,Sheila Broflovski,Look out for yourselves!
192,9,2,Mrs Garrison,Godspeed! [the crew finally enters the digger and closes the door]
193,9,2,Eric Cartman,Primary engine running?
194,9,2,Randy Marsh,Check.
195,9,2,Eric Cartman,Navigation systems?
196,9,2,Linda Stotch,Online
197,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Let's punch this baby. [the digger rolls off its platform] We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on. [the digger lunges into the crowd, tossing hippies left and right, maybe killing a few in the process. Inside, the crew is jostled about] Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?"
198,9,2,Randy Marsh,Vehicle shell holding! [the digger continues clearing a path towards the stage]
199,9,2,Jimbo Kern,They're in!
200,9,2,Townsfolk,"All right! All right, yeah! We did it!"
201,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"[appears with a bandage around her head] All right, people, let's save it! [blood stains are seen on the bandage over both temples. The suicide attempt failed] They still have a long way to go!"
202,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!"
203,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,You're doing what?
204,9,2,Guard,"[an old hippie] Hey, you can't go up there. Hoohoo, woo! [smokes his joint. The digger lurches on. A long shot shows the path the digger is taking]"
205,9,2,Eric Cartman,Switching to secondary fuel line. [warning lights begin to flash and warning sounds are heard] What's that?
206,9,2,Randy Marsh,The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. [the digger stalls and dies]
207,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,What's happened?
208,9,2,Mr Mackey,"They, they s- they stopped. Something's wrong."
209,9,2,Steven Stotch,Jesus... they're dead in the water. [no motion from the digger.] '
210,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing? [the crowd quiets down] It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?"
211,9,2,A hippie,We're using the power of rock and roll to change the world! Woo! [the crowd cheers]
212,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?"
213,9,2,Singer,He's right. It's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing. [the band starts up again. They missed his point entirely. Stan just turns right and walks away]
214,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Come on, come on!"
215,9,2,Linda Stotch,It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.
216,9,2,Randy Marsh,Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
217,9,2,Eric Cartman,"No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!"
218,9,2,Chef,...I didn't volunteer!
219,9,2,Eric Cartman,"...All right, fine Chef, go!"
220,9,2,Chef,"...Aw dammit! [rises from his seat and opens the digger door, facing an atmosphere think with marijuana smoke. He climbs down, coughing pretty hard]"
221,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!
222,9,2,Steven Stotch,God dammit no! Y-you have to give them more time!
223,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here."
224,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
225,9,2,Stan Marsh,"What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? [the stage is shown. All of a sudden the digger smashes into it, stopping the festival in its tracks. The crowd looks towards the stage]"
226,9,2,Man 2,"Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?"
227,9,2,Man 1,More tunes. More tunes! [the digger's door opens and the crew steps out]
228,9,2,Linda Stotch,"We made it, We made it!"
229,9,2,Eric Cartman,Hit the PA system NOW! [the crew goes over to it] Put me in the main line! [Randy turns and shoves an unconscious man at the controls off and gathers some cords]
230,9,2,Randy Marsh,Which cord is it?
231,9,2,Eric Cartman,"You're the scientist, jackass!"
232,9,2,Randy Marsh,I'm a geologist!
233,9,2,Linda Stotch,We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!
234,9,2,Randy Marsh,Nyugh!
235,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Put them in my laptop! [Randy connects one of the cords to the laptop. Cartman selects a song from the Slayer CD he put in the CD-ROM drive: ""Raining Blood"" He clicks ""Play"" and the song blasts forth from the stage speakers. The crowd listens for a while, then begins to disperse.]"
236,9,2,A hippie,"Oh man, not cool."
237,9,2,Hippie 3,[covers his hears and walks off] This music is so angry.
238,9,2,Man 2,This is killing my buzz.
239,9,2,Man 1,Let's bail on this whole angry scene. [the college hippies move off]
240,9,2,Randy Marsh,It's working!
241,9,2,Linda Stotch,What?
242,9,2,Randy Marsh,"It's, it's working!"
243,9,2,Mrs Garrison,We did it! We did it! [the townsfolk cheer and hug each other]
244,9,2,Stan Marsh,Dad!
245,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Stan! [they run up to each other and hug. Nearby, Chef comes to and sits up]"
246,9,2,Chef,"I'm alive! [Kyle walks around aimlessly, but Cartman spots him]"
247,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Hold it right there, Kyle! [Cartman has a small dagger in its sheath. He pulls it out]"
248,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us."
249,9,2,Eric Cartman,Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.
250,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee! [offers the remote control] Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while. [Kyle rises and takes a few steps, but Cartman withdraws the offer] Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!"

Embase,ovid00001,""" In the driver's seat"" : The Health Sector Strategic Master Plan as an instrument for aid coordination in Mongolia.",Ulikpan A.; Narula I.; Malik A.; Hill P.,Article,,,,,,,,"In 2005, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mongolia initiated the process of developing its Health Sector Strategic Master Plan (HSSMP), using a wide-ranging consultative process, driven by the MoH, and requiring participation from all levels of health facilities, other ministries, donor agencies and NGOs. Among other objectives, the MoH sought to coordinate the disparate inputs from key donors through the HSSMP, aligning them with the Plan's structure. This research explores the extent to which the HSSMP process served as a mechanism for effective aid coordination while promoting ownership and capacity building and the lessons learned for the wider international development community. The study is based on document review, key-informant interviews and authors' experience and participation in the MoH planning processes. The HSSMP process improved alignment and harmonisation. It enabled a better local understanding of the benefits of aid coordination, and the recognition that aid coordination as not only a mere administrative task, but a strategic step towards comprehensive management of both domestic and external resources. The process was not challenge free; the fractious political environment, the frequent turnover of key MoH staff, the resistance of some donors towards MoH scrutiny over their programmes and the dismantling of the central coordination and return of seconded staff following completion of the HSSMP, has slowed the pace of reform. Despite the challenges, the approach resulted in positive outcomes in the areas of ownership and better aid coordination, with HSSMP development emphasising ownership and capacity building. This contrasted with the usual outcomes focus, and neglect of the capacity building learning processes and structural and policy changes needed to ensure sustainable change. The largest and most influential programmes in the health sector are now largely aligned with HSSMP strategies, enabling the MoH to utilize these opportunities to optimise the HSSMP outcomes.

In addition to prevention measures, interventions that increase healthcare capacity to manage injuries may be an effective way to decrease morbidity and mortality. A trauma curriculum tailored to low-resource settings was implemented in Managua, Nicaragua utilising traditional didactic methods and novel low-cost simulation methods. Knowledge gain in attending and senior residents was subsequently assessed by using pre- and post-written tests, and by scoring pre- and post-simulation scenarios.;MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5-day trauma course was designed for Nicaraguan attending and senior resident physicians who practice at six hospitals in Managua, Nicaragua. On days 1 and 5, participants underwent pre- and post-training evaluations consisting of a 26-question written exam and 2 simulation cases. The written exam questions and simulations were randomly assigned so that no questions or cases were repeated. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre- and post-training differences in the written exam, and the percentage of critical actions completed in simulations. Time to critical actions was also analyzed using descriptive statistics.;RESULTS: A total of 33 participants attended the course, including 18 (55%) attending and 15 (45%) resident physicians, with a 97% completion rate. After the course, overall written examination scores improved 26.3% with positive mean increase of 15.4% (p<0.001). Overall, simulation scores based on the number of critical actions completed improved by 91.4% with a positive mean increase of 33.67 (p<0.001). The time to critical action for completion of the primary survey and cervical spine immobilisation was reduced by 55.9% and 46.6% respectively.;CONCLUSIONS: A considerable improvement in participants' knowledge of trauma concepts was demonstrated by statistically significant differences in both pre- and post-course written assessments and simulation exercises. The participants showed greatest improvement in trauma simulation scenarios, in which they learned, and subsequently demonstrated, a standardised approach to assessing and managing trauma patients. Low-cost simulation can be a valuable and effective education tool in low- and middle-income countries.;Copyright ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,"Injury. 46(9):1796-800, 2015 Sep"

The workshop was planned with the purpose of encouraging children to write in a setting that emphasized the establishment of a children's library, a related literature-based listening program and a community approach to the sharing of ideas (with experienced writers, group leaders, parents, older children, and peer groups). A multi-age group of primary and early secondary school children (16 in all) participated in the 3-week workshop. Specific workshop activities included storytelling, modeling, revising, editing, learning audience awareness, ""languaging,"" i.e., becoming aware of overused words and hackneyed phrases and being alert to appropriate substitutes; and publishing, i.e., making permanent ""hard-cover"" books out of their own selected writings. The group conferences exerted a positive influence and as a result a confident outlook about reading and writing seemed to emerge. Parents indicated that they saw their children enjoying reading and writing. Children said that they read to try to understand the characters and ""other things."" They also read to look at the illustrations in the stories and to just enjoy a good story. By asking experienced writers to join the team of adult leaders, the children were not only given opportunities to write and learn how their writing unfolds but also to communicate to real audiences (audiences which included professional writers).

The program was a unique and large-scale artificial experiment that showed that such measures can achieve excellent results, and it led to the popular ""APEC blue"" catchphrase (i.e., Beijing's skies became blue as pollution levels decreased). This artificial experiment provided the means to effectively conduct JPCAP strategies in the future. Accordingly, our research focused on the characteristics of the six primary pollutants in Beijing. We found that the JPCAP measures directly reduced concentrations of all pollutants except O<inf>3</inf>. Through correlation analysis, we found that the band distribution of the cities with strong correlations in PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> concentrations was affected by wind conditions. Therefore, JPCAP measures should account for specific seasonal and climatic conditions. Based on cluster analysis using the results from the correlation analysis, we divided 13 cities within a 300-km radius of Beijing into different groups according to the similarity of their PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> correlation coefficients. For JPCAP measures relevant to PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf>, we found differences in the degrees of collaboration among cities. Therefore, depending upon the pollutant type, the JPCAP strategy should account for the cities involved, the scope of the core area, and the optimal cities to involve in the collaborative efforts based on cost-effectiveness and collaborative difficulty among the involved cities.

A Prevention Program for Improving Social Competence in Three-to Seven-Year-Olds","Alba, Guadalupe; Justicia-Arraez, Ana; Pichardo, M Carmen; Justicia-Justicia, Fernando",Article,2013.0,,,,,,,"Behavior problems are often observed in classrooms. The age at which problems appears is increasingly younger, and there are no interventions that ensure a reduction in such behavior problems among school age children. Research and previous evidence show the importance of social competence in this kind of prevention. Working with preschool and primary students must be the main objective, because social competence is a protective factor against behavior problems. In response to these social and educational problems, American and European countries have begun to include universal prevention programs in their curriculum, the ensure the learning of social competence at school. As an example, the pioneering program ""Aprender a Convivir"" [Learn to Live Together] can be considered a preventive intervention that encourages the innovative and optimal development of prosocial behavior in three- to seven year-old children. Its main contents are: rules, feelings and emotions, empathy, communication skills, interpersonal skills, assertiveness and problem solving skills. The framework focuses on increasing social competence and decreasing behavior problems, with the long term results of preventing antisocial behavior. The present contribution aims to first show the importance of working on social competence at school, and second, to present the ""Aprender a Convivir"" program. This program has been implemented in cities of Spain (Granada, Zaragoza), and in other Spanish-speaking countries (Bolivia, Dominican Republic), showing significant differences in the growth of social competence and the reduction of behavior problems.

In recent years, an increasing number of body packers have been hospitalized after their detention by the police upon arrival in Israel. Objectives: To characterize the clinical features and outcomes of body packers hospitalized at the Sheba Medical Center. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case series of body packers hospitalized between January 2010 and October 2012 in our medical center. Electronic medical records and imaging files were reviewed to extract clinical, laboratory and radiological data as well as details on medical treatments. Results: We identified 23 body packers (mean age 38 +/- 10 years), 20 of whom smuggled cocaine from South America. The number of packets transported ranged from 1 to 242 (median 42) and duration of hospitalization from 1 to 14 days (median 2). Two subjects required surgical intervention. All others were treated conservatively by polyethylene glycolelectrolyte lavage solution, laxatives, or watchful waiting. Ten patients underwent a urinary screen for illicit drugs, 7 of whom tested positive for cocaine and 2 for cannabinoids. Abdominal X-rays were performed in all patients at admission, and 14 had follow-up imaging, including abdominal CT scans without contrast media in 8. Conclusions: The main treatment goals for body packers are the rapid excretion of drug packets and early detection of complications, i.e., drug intoxication and bowel obstruction. We suggest the use of a structured treatment approach for the in-hospital management of body packers.",,,"Israel Medical Association Journal. 15 (10) (pp 639-645), 2013.

Exercise behavior was measured by exercise stages of change, exercise self-efficacy, exercise decisional balance, and moderate-intensity exercise duration (min/week) at baseline and immediately after the eight week intervention.When compared to baseline, only patients in the exercise stage-matched intervention group demonstrated significant progress in the exercise stages of change, higher exercise self-efficacy, fewer exercise barriers, and longer duration of moderate-intensity exercise after the eight week intervention. A significant difference in the progress in the exercise stages of change was found among the three groups after the eight week intervention.

Methods: In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, four male schools in Irbid, Jordan, were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 215) or comparison (n = 218) groups. Trained educators trained senior students from the four schools to be peer leaders (n = 53), who then taught peers in grades 7 and 8 (n = 433). The peer leaders in the intervention schools implemented the smoke-free pledge within the 7th and 8th graders, who voluntarily signed the pledge for 4 months. The comparison group received the same intervention components as the intervention group, minus the smoke-free pledge. Data were collected from students in grades 7 and 8 at baseline and 4 months post-intervention. Results: Students from the intervention group reported significant improvements in smoking-related knowledge and perception and lower nicotine dependence as compared to the comparison group. Improvement in asthma control was greater in nonsmokers versus smokers. Conclusions: Voluntary group commitment smoke-free through a pledge is an incentive to motivate adolescents to abstain from smoking.

They review the limited literature on medical student suicide and suggest that no comprehensive study has ever occurred. They believe that the available data are too limited to conclude what the rate of death by suicide is among medical students compared to their age-matched peers. The authors speculate that the lack of accurate data may be related both to reluctance on the part of schools to report deaths by suicide, and to the failure of national organizations like the Association of American Medical Colleges, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and Liaison Committee on Medical Education to mandate reporting. The authors believe that without reliable data the medical education community will never be able to determine whether any trends or predictors are connected to medical student death by suicide and, as a result, intervening in a meaningful way will remain impossible. The authors call on the national organizing bodies of medical education to mandate reporting of deaths by suicide, and to create and maintain a database for tracking and studying these events. They advocate public access to unidentified data, linking medical schools to the number of deaths by suicide, as another method of creating accountability and influencing medical school behavior in addressing this tragic phenomenon.'",,,Muller,David,D,,"B.M.

Counting the cases reported as such to the university administration, a total of 65 students committed suicide during the 20 years from 1962 till 1981. This amounts to a yearly average of 25.6 cases per 100,000 students. A comparison of this quota with that of several Japanese and foreign universities is made. In 1970, the year in which the students unrest at the Japanese universities reached its peak, the frequency of the suicide fell to its all time low. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is proposed. Out of the 65 students who committed suicide, 25 (38%) have at least once visited the psychiatric clinic of the Tokyo University. In view of the high percentage of the mentally disturbed students in the total number of suicides, the importance of measures taken of foster the mental health of the students is stressed for reasons of suicide prophylaxis. The issue in most of these cases was the conflict between the required scholastic accomplishments and the failure of achieving them. The resulting frustration becomes the immediate motive of the suicide. Therefore, a more intensive psychiatric care of such students is recommended especially during the examination season from January till May, when in Japan the students are exposed to the highest psychological stress.

We make concrete recommendations on how to evaluate replications with more nuance than what is typically done currently in the literature. We highlight six study characteristics that are crucial for evaluating replications: replication method similarity, replication differences, investigator independence, method/data transparency, analytic result reproducibility, and auxiliary hypotheses’ plausibility evidence. We also recommend a more nuanced approach to statistically interpret replication results at the individual-study and meta-analytic levels, and propose clearer language to communicate replication results.",transparency;  reproducibility;  direct replication;  replicability;  evaluating replications,,None to declare.,"European Commission (Marie-Curie grant, Project ID: 793669: EP LeBel, W Vanpaemel)",R Carlsson,MB Nuijten; U Schimmack,https://osf.io/dsn72/

Published research, however, can be useful for theory or application only if it is credible. In science, a credible finding is one that has repeatedly survived risky falsification attempts. However, state-of-the-art meta-analytic approaches cannot determine the credibility of an effect because they do not account for the extent to which each included study has survived such attempted falsification. To overcome this problem, we outline a unified framework for estimating the credibility of published research by examining four fundamental falsifiability-related dimensions: (a) transparency of the methods and data, (b) reproducibility of the results when the same data-processing and analytic decisions are reapplied, (c) robustness of the results to different data-processing and analytic decisions, and (d) replicability of the effect. This framework includes a standardized workflow in which the degree to which a finding has survived scrutiny is quantified along these four facets of credibility. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to published replications in the psychology literature. Finally, we outline a Web implementation of the framework and conclude by encouraging the community of researchers to contribute to the development and crowdsourcing of this platform.",research credibility; transparency; open science; analytic reproducibility; analytic robustness; replicability,"E.

We agree multiple scientific goals are essential, but argue, however, a more fine-grained language, conceptualization, and approach to replication is needed to accomplish these goals. Replication is the general empirical mechanism for testing and falsifying theory. Sufficiently methodologically similar replications, also known as direct replications, test the basic existence of phenomena and ensure cumulative progress is possible a priori. In contrast, increasingly methodologically dissimilar replications, also known as conceptual replications, test the relevance of auxiliary hypotheses (e.g., manipulation and measurement issues, contextual factors) required to productively investigate validity and generalizability. Without prioritizing replicability, a field is not empirically falsifiable. We also disagree with FER2016’s position that “bigger samples are generally better, but... that very large samples could have the downside of commandeering resources that would have been better invested in other studies” (abstract). We identify problematic assumptions involved in FER2016’s modifications of our original research-economic model, and present an improved model that quantifies when (and whether) it is reasonable to worry that increasing statistical power will engender potential trade-offs. Sufficiently powering studies (i.e., 80%) maximizes both research efficiency and confidence in the literature (research quality). Given that we are in agreement with FER2016 on all key open science points, we are eager to start seeing the accelerated rate of cumulative knowledge development of social psychological phenomena such a sufficiently transparent, powered, and falsifiable approach will generate.",direct replication; falsification; power; replicability; transparency,,None to declare.,None to declare.,K Kawakami,"R Giner-Sorolla, Anonymous reviewer 2, Anonymous reviewer 3, Anonymous reviewer 4",

We scrutinize these researchers’ (a) statistical concern that heightened stringency with respect to false-positives will increase false-negatives and (b) metascientific concern that larger samples and executing direct replications engender opportunity costs that will decrease the rate of making novel discoveries. We argue their statistical concern is unwarranted given open science proponents recommend such practices to reduce the inflated Type I error rate from .35 down to .05 and simultaneously call for high-powered research to reduce the inflated Type II error rate. Regarding their metaconcern, we demonstrate that incurring some costs is required to increase the rate (and frequency) of making true discoveries because distinguishing true from false hypotheses requires a low Type I error rate, high statistical power, and independent direct replications. We also examine pragmatic concerns raised regarding adopting open science practices for relationship science (preregistration, open materials, open data, direct replications, sample size); while acknowledging these concerns, we argue they are overstated given available solutions. We conclude benefits of open science practices outweigh costs for both individual researchers and the collective field in the long run, but that short term costs may exist for researchers because of the currently dysfunctional academic incentive structure. Our analysis implies our field’s incentive structure needs to change whereby better alignment exists between researcher’s career interests and the field’s cumulative progress. We delineate recent proposals aimed at such incentive structure realignment.",open science practices; independent replication; cumulative knowledge; analytic and design flexibility,,None to declare.,None to declare.,RC Fraley,"Anonymous reviewer 1, M Kraus",

Participants primed to think about their commitment to their partner (high commitment) reacted to the betrayals with reduced exit and neglect responses relative to those primed to think about their independence from their partner (low commitment). The priming manipulation did not affect constructive voice and loyalty responses. Although other studies have demonstrated a correlation between subjective commitment and responses to betrayal, this study provides the only experimental evidence that inducing changes to subjective commitment can causally affect forgiveness responses. This Registered Replication Report (RRR) meta-analytically combines the results of 16 new direct replications of the original study, all of which followed a standardized, vetted, and preregistered protocol. The results showed little effect of the priming manipulation on the forgiveness outcome measures, but it also did not observe an effect of priming on subjective commitment, so the manipulation did not work as it had in the original study. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancy between the findings from this RRR and the original study.

In the face of this replicability “crisis of confidence”, several initiatives have been implemented to increase the reliability of empirical findings. In the current article, I propose a new replication norm that aims to further boost the dependability of findings in psychology. Paralleling the extant social norm that researchers should peer review about three times as many articles that they themselves publish per year, the new replication norm states that researchers should aim to independently replicate important findings in their own research areas in proportion to the number of original studies they themselves publish per year (e.g., a 4:1 original-to-replication studies ratio). I argue this simple approach could significantly advance our science by increasing the reliability and cumulative nature of our empirical knowledge base, accelerating our theoretical understanding of psychological phenomena, instilling a focus on quality rather than quantity, and by facilitating our transformation toward a research culture where executing and reporting independent direct replications is viewed as an ordinary part of the research process. To help promote the new norm, I delineate (1) how each of the major constituencies of the research process (i.e., funders, journals, professional societies, departments, and individual researchers) can incentivize replications and promote the new norm and (2) any obstacles each constituency faces in supporting the new norm.",independent replication; cumulative knowledge; replication norm,,None to declare.,None to declare.,S Vazire,"K Corker, Anonymous reviewer 2",http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ubiquity-partner-network/ucp/journal/collabra/collabra-pr-23-v2.pdf

Using Monte Carlo methods, we evaluated various models of socially desirable responding by systematically adding predetermined amounts of the bias to the simulated personality trait scores of hypothetical test respondents before computing test–criterion validity correlations. Our study generally supported previous findings that have reported relatively minor decrements in criterion prediction, even with personality scores that were massively infused with desirability bias. Furthermore, the response bias failed to reveal itself as a statistical moderator of test validity or as a suppressor of validity. Large differences between some respondents’ obtained test scores and their true trait scores, however, meant that the personality measure’s construct validity would be severely compromised and, more specifically, that estimates of those individuals’ criterion performance would be grossly in error. Our discussion focuses on reasons for the discrepant results reported in the literature pertaining to the effect of socially desirable responding on criterion validity.

authorized user is member of, in any capacity. When a user becomes a member of an organization in CKAN they’re given a
“capacity” (sometimes called a “role”), for example “member”, “editor” or
“admin”. Each of these roles has certain permissions associated with it. For example
the admin role has the “admin” permission (which means they have permission
to do anything). The editor role has permissions like “create_dataset”,
“update_dataset” and “delete_dataset”.  The member role has the “read”
permission. This function returns the list of organizations that the authorized user
has a given permission for. For example the list of organizations that the
user is an admin of, or the list of organizations that the user can create
datasets in. This takes account of when permissions cascade down an
organization hierarchy.",/organization_list_for_user

ckan.logic.action.get.resource_search,resource_search,ckan.action.get.,"Searches for resources satisfying a given search criteria. It returns a dictionary with 2 fields: count and results.  The
count field contains the total number of Resources found without the
limit or query parameters having an effect.  The results field is a
list of dictized Resource objects. The ‘query’ parameter is a required field.  It is a string of the form
{field}:{term} or a list of strings, each of the same form.  Within
each string, {field} is a field or extra field on the Resource domain
object. If {field} is ""hash"", then an attempt is made to match the
{term} as a prefix of the Resource.hash field. If {field} is an extra field, then an attempt is made to match against
the extra fields stored against the Resource. Note: The search is limited to search against extra fields declared in
the config setting ckan.extra_resource_fields. Note: Due to a Resource’s extra fields being stored as a json blob, the
match is made against the json string representation.  As such, false
positives may occur: If the search criteria is: Then a json blob with the string representation of: will match the search criteria!  This is a known short-coming of this
approach. All matches are made ignoring case; and apart from the ""hash"" field,
a term matches if it is a substring of the field’s value. Finally, when specifying more than one search criteria, the criteria are
AND-ed together. The order parameter is used to control the ordering of the results.
Currently only ordering one field is available, and in ascending order
only. The fields parameter is deprecated as it is not compatible with calling
this action with a GET request to the action API. The context may contain a flag, search_query, which if True will make
this action behave as if being used by the internal search api.  ie - the
results will not be dictized, and SearchErrors are thrown for bad search
queries (rather than ValidationErrors).",/resource_search
